1,S _TV,1,Terrible game. The algorithm is really messed up. Nothing compared to real time ludo. Apparently this game favours one player over other. I wish I could give it zero stars or maybe negative stars if that was at all possible. Nonsense. This game needs to be re configured. The source code writers are a terrible mess. Get them fired. If anyone during this lockdown is to be fired. They should be the preference.
2,Niya Gancheva,2,"The algorithm is too repetitive. I can predict what another player will get almost all of the time, especially in tense situation. There are very distinct patterns that are spread across the different games and after some time they just become the same. Also taking tokens is a very common occurrence, almost every 4th or 5th turn, which is definitely not the case in the real board game."
3,Anyones Profy,1,"Initially the game was fun to play. But today this game sucked badly. It moves the pieces on its own. I have a screen recording if you want. What is the point playing a game where it glitches so much that it costs you the game. Seems like it was a ghost playing and I was just watching. You are initially worth 5 star, now even you don't deserve 1 star."
4,Kaushal Patel,1,"As far as I played this game I found it like all set up. With the beginning of the game one player is very favourable most likely to win the game. whereas otherone is found very dim and to lose the game, rest two are average players (if first player makes few mistakes then one of them get chance to win only.) So fix this issue and give random dices to every player and give equal chance to every one and let them use theire mind or skill to win the board.. Thank you..!!"
5,mayank kumar,1,"Most biased game ever. In every game, I am the last one to get six. I get ones in a row for 3 or 4 times in a row quite often. I have to chase others to cut them but others cut me very easily even if I m on the verge of getting home by getting 6-6-5 so often that I get the feeling the feeling that I am not getting in and it actually happens. Can u explain all this, ludo king team?"
6,Nilesh Verma,1,Worst game ever played. Never install this. This is not actual ludo. There is nothing call random and luck. Every thing is well programmed and it is decided in the beginning of game that who will win. No matter how much lead you have in the game. Most important thing.. Its addictive game not due to your interest but the algorithm they used for winnig and loosing . The most important part is acquiring coins which makes you more eager to play. Once you start playing you can't stop. Don't install
7,Ganesh Krishnan,1,"I've been reading most of the reviews and whatever mentioned here is correct. The person who has the most number of coins and most played will always win. The algorithm is set in such a way to favor the higher end players. There is a targeted target player,a top end player and 2 moderate players..obviously the game is an addictive one but still the algorithm sucks."
8,Anuj Gupta,4,"Hi Ludo King Team, One suggestion on the algorithm: When people think they are not going to be either 1st or 2nd, they quit the game because anyways they are going to loose all of their spent coins. I would suggest not to deduct 100% of the coins who comes at 3rd position. Deduct 60 or 70% or anything but not 100%. Though thanks for the great game :)"
9,Dinesh Thapa,1,"This is the most fixed game, i have ever played in my life. i was just one place far from winning the game many times but one never came on dice but for my opponent completed one round & own at last. Around 18-19 throws didn't give 1,what type of setting is this??Not once or twice,its happen many times. This is just a fixed game where most indians win ! Totally wast. I don't want to give any rating......."
10,Suryaprakash Shukla,1,"This is the worst game ever, it always wants to bring to the last tile and never make the player wins. The other player can open their 4 token and win in that time. Why did the developers do that? You have no authority to interfere with tokens. You have a fake team. I guess the entire team is just a bunch of useless people with no brains. Education can only allow you to make good applications but to put life in that, you never learn in any school. You fraudsters have made money you don't deserve"
11,Vijay Kumar Verma,1,"The algorithm used by ludo King is not random and is based on the number of coins you have purchased from site, it favours you when you buy the coins from site and you will start losing when you keep on playing with existing base. Even in their 7 UP DOWN game, when you win once or twice you are bound to lose n number of times till your tally goes below the existing level. Ludo king you are doing great job in earning money. People think they are playing game but it's a different game altogether."
12,Kiran Turme,1,"The worst game in the Play Store. It is so very predictable and manipulative, that it manages to irritate me to another level. And the 5 stupid chances you give that users use as a lucky role, especially to get either a 6 or a 1 is what makes this game win the WORST LUDO GAME AWARD. With an intention of making the game over thrilling to get it as close as possible, you have at least managed to lose me as a user, and I hope I'm not the only one. Wish there was a 0 or lower than tht rating avlble."
13,ankit raj,1,"Write a algo to generate random number. It's almost pridcted like whenever some one is reaching to others area, the other one will get a 6, atleast in initial moment. Also, if some is having more point compared to other.. other tends to loose.... Whatever be the scenario... Even if he's all inside home..but will not be winner. Atleast this is a case when 2 player are only playing."
14,Kayode Makinde,1,"I'm not trying to say it's not a bad game. I'm just saying that it is stupidly unfair. There's bad luck sure. But the amount of bad luck in this game that can ruin your entire game is incredible. It's like if you buy coins, it makes you fail so you need to buy more. I can't play this game anymore. I hate games where I feel cheated. It's one thing to lose, another thing to feel like you were made to lose"
15,saurabh patel,1,"Very predictable game, the algorithms are too bad. 1 it is almost impossible for your 2 tokens to land on same place. 2 in two players you can always guess when you will get 6. You will get 1 all the time but hard time if you are way ahead of opponent and near home. 3. You will always get killed if near opponent house and are in lead. 4.way too many bots Keep it random guys remove algorithms"
16,A Google user,1,Worst game ever . when I newly downloaded I used to get 6 and used to win but what happened now as I've been noticing after playing with lots of hardwork I lose on last point every time .how can this be happened .I play at least 10 times and every time I fail eventhough I play very well.they are biases I agree.If this is going to happen for few of days I'm sure I'm gonna uninstall this application.
17,Transark Staffing,1,"At first I liked this app, but I am very disappointed that this AI doesnot let you win and keep on giving you some different no.,s other than you need at the end part of the game if you have already got 3 of your points in . It makes it impossible for one to win . The dice numbers are not random."
18,Tushar Singh,1,Worst game ever. Its totally fixed as 1 player will always be favoured by the software and 1 will loose no matter what they do. I can say this as i have been on both ends of the spectrum. It makes strategy and smarts obsolete as no matter how you play you'll win or loose depending on whether the game wants you to win or not. Dice rolls are decided in manner which can make d game go on for the longest period of time. Quantity can never be a substitute for quality. Waiting for a good alternative.
19,Abdul Salam,2,"Most of the time I am getting message ""Connecting to server"". Also while playing the game with friends my connection with server is lost. It is also too annoying to wait for game to reestablish connection with server. My internet speed is good and I have recently updated the game to version v5.0.0.154."
20,Varun vkkp,2,"I don't know what happened. At the first time, I enjoyed this game. But right now, I can not play this because it closes automatically. I have got about 21.7k coins and 120+ diamonds. But now all are going to lose. An another problem is that it takes more time to open with battery drainage"
21,Tushar Gupta,1,It's really a disgusting game. Fully computer operated. I would really insist the company to work on this. It's really bad that few players get 6 very rarely. And also that to install a function of operating the number next after we get six to be played first. Please app has to work on these things
22,Robin Chawla,1,"Pathetic App. This game is biased, winner is predefined no matter how good player moves the token. If your all tokens are near ur house and opponents token are still inside you won't get numbers to clear the game till opponents almost all tokens reach near the house. Sometimes in first turn if u get 6 u won't be able to do anything, stupid game freezes till the auto move. If you need one in last and opponent has three tokens left he will win. The so called random generator dice program will suck"
23,Shirshendu Lahiri,1,Changing my rating from 5 to 1 stars.Basically what i have observed is that the game predecides who is going to win and if you are the opponent you cannot win no matter what you do.The rest of the players have a close competition requiring 1 or 2 to win. And the game says that the dice thrown is always random. Random my ass.
24,Rashmi Ramesh,1,"Man every time am almost about to win ... Just a single pawn left , but the other players seem to get the exact number the need to kill me ... God knows what logic this game has . Also if the player has more coins it's obvious that that players win .... The dies roll is just like gives the exact number that need to kill me .."
25,Shri Mittal,1,At first i like this game but after i observed that it always decides that who will be the winner and do partiality with other player. When dice rolles it gives big numbers to other player and 1or 2 to other player. If you're level is bigger from other player still you will get small numbers. Didn't expected this cheating.Totally disappointed\U0001f620\U0001f621
26,Arco Chakraborty,2,Hey Guys your app was great until the update on the 5th May 2020 . The app won't work for 5 minutes straight before crashing or flickering or simply getting stuck I am using the app on my my one plus 6T Kindly look into this it will be a shame to uninstall the game after being a avid user for a better part of 2 months Please fix it !!
27,Sakthi Priya,1,The very very worst game I have ever played. I have lost many games without getting the proper die number. It has already planned on which player to win and gives tosses according to it. Please don't install this. I lost all my coins because of its missions and challenges.
28,Prabhakar Shukla,1,"Absolutely AI based algo. It's not very obvious at first but after a few games you will definitely realise something is wrong. Not because you are losing but because you have played actual ludo and are aware of what reality feels like. There is a lot of AI meddling going on in this game. Specially if you have paid them some money for any reason like themes etc, they will know that this person mat possibly make future purchases and wil make you lose game after game and force you buy again!"
29,Chinmay Parakh,1,"Network error appears every now and then.. My Wifi and Internet has never given me any problems so far which makes me question on this game..This error is not an actual error, it's just someone from the Ludo Team wanting me dead or out of the game which doesn't make any sense. I hope you guys look into this and make an update with satisfactory solution. Thanks!"
30,DHIRAJ GUPTA,1,Worst ludo game available on play store and simply dumbest coded game. Someone wins the match continuosly and someone loses again and again. Enemy has 3 token outside and i have only one inside with only 1 place to go but still i lost the game as after throwing dice 28 times ( yes i counted ) i didn't get 1 and opponent wins. read many reviews and all are saying the same problem with the dice. Kindly employ some decent app maker ( who knows the job ) and make it more competitive game
31,ZIA Hasan,2,"Though the game is good but the app is very frustrating. It keep on showing ""connecting to server"" on online mode. Doesnt matter how many times you start the app or reboot your phone altogether it just doesnt connect. Uninstalled the app many a times but that also didnt solve the issue."
32,Naren N,1,"The game takes complete one side at times. Not fair to play and waste the time. Game with random opponents is not upto the mark. It makes unfair matches like for level 2 player against level 300+ player. Where the later enjoys favourable probability numbers to beat the other. At times the game completely takes a side with good numbers consistently. It may be a trick to force the player to purchase coins, but not a fair game to play. Logged off online, keeping only for playing within family."
33,Ribhav Thakur,1,"I'm not sure this is happening to me only or others also.Each time I play only my token gets captured & I rarely succeed to get even a single token of others.Whenever the die rolls my tokens are doomed.I don't know why? I know your game works with probability but that doesn't mean that P(my token will be caught)=0.99999999 My opinion is,you don't even deserve a single star.I'm not going to play this game anymore . And one last thing who gave the right to you saying ""best game on google play"".\U0001f621"
34,Sagar Pastariya,1,there are so much bugs in the games when i am playing .the opponent player all 4 token has outside from her range. & my only token left to win inside the safe range only 2 no. is left to winning me but at the other side my 2 is not coming in dice in 20times what is these wrong if it is a randomly dice then also my token takes maximum 10-15 times but opponent is winning . please remove these bugs
35,anupama Das,1,It's a super fun way to spend time.. but do not expect to win.. over the past three days..while constantly playing somehow even though i will have just one token to take one step.. opponents who had two three tokens ends up winning.. the online game is rigged.. i understand losing sometimes... but ending the same way multiple times makes me suspicious.. anyway.. if u don't care about winning.. this is great app ! still fun to play.. but losing the same exact way continuously is boring..
36,madhuri dhawan,2,"In the beginning its amazing but once you reach a higher level or earn good amount of coins, you start losing each and every game . No matter how well you play , winning becomes almost impossible. This is disappointing as numbers dont seem to be random."
37,Saumya Jain,1,I would've given it zero stars if I had the option. The game is extremely rigged. I have consecutively lost multiple matches. It gets frustrating after a point when you know that the algorithm pre decides who is going to win the game. Would not recommend.
38,Manivannan Sathyamangalam,1,"I have already mentioned some points to show it's not a random dice. Here's another one. Say opponents gets a six initially and he comes around near my area. 98% of the time he gets another six ""after he got near my entry point but before crossing my entry point"" . So that he ll move the newly cleared piece thereby avoiding crossing my entry point. If it is random, I m sure I won't use 98% in my point. Make me clear why my online opponent is 99.5% of higher level than me?"
39,Guddu Raja,1,Worst algorithm designed by programmers. Your strategy is nothing to defeat your opponent because it is decided by the Ludo King who will be winner no matter opponent has any strategy or not. People play the game for fun that makes people happy. But Ludo King gives unnecessary stress to people who is playing well. I think it shouldn't happened.
40,Pekir Yomcha,1,"Just for the sake of competition the opponent always has the perfect no. up everytime. I don't understand that, I also want to add tha your game just makes you feel so less about yourself and makes you doubt whether you are good at all, I sincerely hate that you guys have made such a fun game suck to the utmost level, this can't get any worse, Improve it make it less predictable make it more fun, bring the original ludo back, the one that doesn't have anything to do with your money making scheme"
41,Rahul Sharma,1,"This game is not a random based. The algorithm doesn't allow me to get high numbers when required and gives me only a one. When I require only a win at match point, it gives me fours, fives and sixes which become useless. Developers need to fix this issue otherwise I have to uninstall this game for its unfairness."
42,Anantkumar Wankhade,1,"Worst ludo version guyz they people manage the game as per coins and diamonds. Once you buy something, they make win at starting then lost you to under coins. The programming is done so that you should buy coins and diamonds pack. Please download waste your precious money with this type of fraud games. You can try another ludo."
43,Jitendra Sharma,1,"Never install it ! Initially, It was good but after gaining a huge number of subscriber, they mould it for only business purpose not for entertainment. If I'd have a option for choosing for star the I give 0 star even -ve too. Game setting is so worst. Played around 30 or more game but always loose even in closer moment. Waited for mostly 1 to pass the game even after the opponent have 3 outside but opponent gets win that is much frustrating part. The worst part is waiting for 1 to pass but \U0001f62d"
44,Manish Kunder,1,It feels like you are playing with a bot instead of a person. The gameplay is devised to make you struggle till the end point. And 7 up 7 down is just a way to rip you off your coins. You will never win in that. Trust me when I say that. Instead of being a stress buster it is a stress booster.
45,Hanwant singh,1,"It just take ages to connect to it's server . I mean I'm having a really good internet speed but still it just won't connect to it's damn servers .edit-( this game is justtt trash.It clearly says login with fb and the data will be saved. And it worked fine i reinstall (because of the issue i mentioned earlier)the game several times and got my coins and theme back. But after resetting my phone. i logged in with fb account and i lost everything(100000 coin worth theme + 50000 coins).......""trash"""
46,Deep Kaur,1,Very unfair........so much disappointed ......from last 12 games opponents keeps on getting 6 on their dice......and if i manage to play opponents get exact numbers and puts me back........and sometimes even after playing very well......at the end opponents win......don't know how.......so i lose mah interest in this game.....
47,Kaustubh Khedkar,4,Great Game. Only one problem - Autoplay. Because of this I lost some games. Most often the player goes away without closing the app and the Autoplay takes over. Unfortunately due to this the player which has left wins... Doesn't make any sense. So remove the Autoplay. Also please update so that 6 players can play online
48,Prasan Nayak,1,"This app is worst gaming app ever I had played. The dice rolls are never random. This app Algorithm for dice is the worst \U0001f44e. If you will play with someone who had less coins than you Or that person who is a regular player then 99.99% chances are that you will defeat. After playing this game it really sucks. How this type of 3rd grade app is developed by it's team. So i uninstalled it. Don't download it nd play, otherwise you will loose your peace of mind. \U0001f44e\U0001f44e\U0001f44e\U0001f44e\U0001f44e\U0001f44e\U0001f44e\U0001f44e"
49,Shruti Puri,1,Very biased game.... No random roll of dice. It's all controlled depending how much coins you spend in buying themes et al. If you are not spending coins bam you will stop getting sixes on dice... All other players will reach to their destination and you will still comfortably sitting at your home. Opponents will keep taking your token and you will not get favorable numbers to take your opponent's token. Time waste. Use yalla ludo
50,AQUIB JAWED,1,The random function of this is not random. In this game it is pre-planned that who will win. Developer please make sure that you shouldn't make such stupid non-sense game. Where the player wouldn't find it interesting to play. And please re-visit your random function.
51,Shreyans Jhabak,1,"It's super pathetically designed, for some mobile you will always win and for some mobile you do what ever you can u won't win at all coz its just so awful designed, no matter how good strategy you use n play it's all waste coz it will make sure that it's just the the computer decide who will win this game."
52,Nithi Kiruba,4,It's worse becoz.... whenever i open ads for free coins..it automatically exits the app and it is get started from first...i really disappointed......but i \u2665\ufe0f to play ludo....i don't have any error in my phn....plz check this guys........................................i don't wanna disappoint u guys...but this is my problem....Moreover this is a trending app nowadays....congrats\u2665\ufe0f......i used to tell my friends about this app to install it and we play and njoyed........wishes for ur efforts...\u2665
53,Rahul Soni,1,"95% people are hackers. They hacked the game and loot us. My internet and mobile data is always on but in game it's showing no internet connection. If we didn't play we have 15-20 sec time,and 5 chances we have. But in 1 minutes all our 5 chances gone and that player won. How it is possible"
54,anu sardana,1,Such a biased game don't waste ur time to install it and I will give 0 star just hate this game it is fixed who wins every opponent get 6 on. Every roll and they get same no. what they want and when I go in their home they get no. And cut my token but when they come I don't get no. To cut token at that time I only got 1 or even 3 times I lost because I don't get one \U0001f47f\U0001f47f\U0001f47f\U0001f47f dont install it
55,Mr.SUMIT SAINI,1,When i play the mission then error occur of internet issue but on my device no internet problem.The whole things is discussed with support team but no one help me to resolve this problem and no backup provide to me. So i suggest to others don't waste our time to play this. When you are on top and error let you down then nobody help and support .Unbeleiveable i have need only one to win the game but second player have 3 dice starts from but he win and i lost that is impossible to my think
56,Mahesh,1,"biased game. player with more coins will always win and worst computerised game ever. my opponent always getting highest number and i am getting lowest number whole game. my opponent got 3 of his player win and i am still in home. i would have given negative if there was option. dont download, always prefer the original one guys, its a computerised game with computer giving you numbers."
57,MANORANJAN HEMBROM,1,absolutely not the one i used to play.it clearly appears now a days it is biased.there is no difference between ludo club and ludo king. While playing 2 players game it favours one player.( My experience) my opponent was losing and all time i was getting numbers exactly to kill my opponent. the last game i played before this rating i was losing exactly the same way as my opponent lost. THE ONLY OPTION NOW UNINSTALL .PLEASE GIVE A CHANCE TO OTHER LUDO..DO NOT INSTALL THIS HAME.
58,Divya Patel,1,"It may be the best app for ludo but to me, its not at all good because I have been losing the game. It's Totally unfair when opponents are getting sixes and fives and you get only ones and twos. They should improve the game algorithm/game design. Hence only 1 star."
59,Nimesh Kotak,2,"Suffering from don't know Technically Issues wth d APP..

61,A Google user,5,"Game nice ....nice graphic color good Everything is good but. Wat I feel is when we play online match with friend and to send request there should be a option that which player is online and which player is offline and which player is playing a match or marching a group to paly a match so then we can send the request easily than we can know that o this player is online than we can paly with this player so that I feel. Nothing than that everything is good and game is marvelous,..........."

Seriously pissed off with this.. Someone play games on phn when they are boared... At the same time your app shoe their tantrums... Resolved it N O W !!!"
63,Ashish Saini,1,this is a worst game but since i installed this game in my smartphone ...from that time to till now ...every time i played this worst game ..in one full game ...i got 6 only 1-3 time ...on the other hand my opponents in each nd every game gets 6 more times like 10-15 . this worst game gives me 1 again and again .. why this happend ..just answer me .. its not fair
64,Hema Rawat,1,"It's total fraud game I'd say this....people don't play with a luck and with no's. Everything's pre-decided , no matter how hard you'll try u couldn't win at all.one will get thousand times 6 and what you'll get is only 1 and 2. And plus you'll never get number u need and the other person will definitely get it. Been playing this for so long but should say, hate this game!"
65,Vvk KvV,1,"Please write below your feedback / issue:  hi, the game was wrost, when I'm finish my game in that time it's Struked, and automatically the dice is moving with out my action, serioully I'm not going to suggest this game for anyone. wrost experience with this game Big cheating i hate this game don't Download \U0001f621\U0001f620"
66,sekhar shukla,1,Very poor experience. Few people gets 6 very frequently and few people just dont. Very biased game. Algorithm cant be biased. Its get very frustrating when you dont get numbers. There is some glitch in the game. Everytime it can not be luck. Hope the makers will resolve the issue and ppl will stop getting frustrated
67,Abdul Taufiq,5,"Hey, developers! I played this game and it's awesome! But below I ma mentioning some things need to be improve. It'll definitely give a new hike to your application. Allow some custom chats options, allow voice communication among players and please stop making rooms there because it makes me so irritating. Thanks \U0001f60a"
68,Shaikh Sameer,1,"Seems very biased one. The players who hav3 completed any missions will always get extra benefits during the game and probability of winning against them is too less, completing missions is always very difficult for new player, unwanted ads for purchasing coins and diamonds."
69,mohd junaid,4,Hi I'm playing this game from years & clear all stages & won 6 frames now I face problem of auto play not because of my network I think it's a problem of server hanging or hacking.. cos of that I lost so many games.. One massage for the players of ludo king plz play game like a game don't hack. Please fix it.
70,Priti Pawar,1,Intentionally game makes opponent to win. Even though I have chance to win. Worst game ever. I m going to uninstall it. Its supposed to b based on luck ... But development is totally unfair .. I don't like this game anymore .... Keep it fair else u will loose customers like m. 😠
71,Vikram Sangwan,1,"The whole point of dice game is element of ""randomness"", however there is nothing random about this game.... Entire play is algorithm controlled for the sake of excitement.... Horrible idea.... This game has nothing like Ludo game and entirely manipulated with algorithms to make it addictive. Yes, that's the point of it, to make it addictive."
72,Aakash Jain,1,Such a poor game I have ever had. How can Google Play give rating no. 1. Google Play should be aware while giving a rating and it never give equal chance to both the players one get bigger numbers and another always smaller you should improve the quality of your system.
73,Kuldeep Kamble,1,"Very disappointing. The game play is very predictive. The A.I decides a colour token\u2666\ufe0f to be won. Then for that colour, the dice will be rolled as 6-6-5 most of the time. This favoured colour token\u2666\ufe0f will get all the chances to bold other colour tokens\U0001f7e8\U0001f7e9\U0001f7e6. After this favoured coloured token\u2666\ufe0f is won 1st. Then A.I will favour another colour token\U0001f537 and give the dice rolled numbers as 6s and 5s. In the last stage of the game when only two players are remaining, A.I will create suspense\U0001f611."
74,Dipshikha Phukan,1,"It's the worst game ever.... This game is highly biased... I would have given 0 star,if there were any option for that..... In one word, the game is ""FALTU"".. ""FALTU"" at its best... And no matter how many times people complain about it, they won't give any heed to it.... Worst experience...."
75,Srinidhi M,1,"Created by absolutely novice developers, the algorithm is very predictable just to keep up with the game going. The edge cases can be unnatural in the game. Like the casino, the game is always the winner and never the player."
76,naveen saharan,1,"Totally biased game. The guy who has more coin will definitely get more sixes and atlast will win. Played continuously 30 games against the persons who have more coins, and most of them got sixes numerous times. In absence of zero star, in helplessness i have to give one star."
77,Sheeva Setoodeh,4,We have lots of fun playing this game but the only problem is that mostly you can tell who's going to win from the five first rollings. This is the biggest issue everyone has complained here so please do something about it. This game would be dreamy if you add voice messages for friends. Thanks.
78,Kavita Shukla,1,"Such a biased game. Instead of being random, it uses some f*ed up algorithm for the values. You might be needing just one, but instead it will make your opponents win. Stupid game. Destroying all the childhood memories."
79,Shifa Kausar,1,"There is something wrong with this app. Everyone can get the exact number and hit my token but when my turn comes I don't get the number, thus has happen a hundred times. Every player wins easily. Like I have lost 5 matches continously 🤬😤 Fix this jerk app."
80,anup sharma,1,I m on a platform where i have found the app wastage of time as i have been observed that those who have level 2 are defeating me where i am having 59 level... And continuously how someone can get loss all tge games... I was having 2 milion coins and i have observed while having all the tokens in my home opponents are winning with no reason likely seems for their winning. So poor..
81,Abhishek Puri,1,"Never trust the Ludo game for coins, and in this game in 7 up down in fix That your coins will take all this So Ludo game is not trustworthy at all, and in 7 up down in fix That you first win only for 1000, and 2000 coin After that you lost all coins becuase this is a fixed, I would have given this game a rating below 1 if there was an option."
82,Vivek Gajjar,2,The dice rolls in a way that it kills the player who doesn't play by the book. If you try something new you're gone. I hope you have fixed the connectivity issue in the new update. Randomize the dice algorithm to 100%. This game taught me not to make wrong move in life.
83,Harindersingh Araich,1,It's not well designed app I think because when ever u makes a big room it stops working a moment it shows internet connection error and an countdown of 60 sec appears but after a few moments of setting everything right it again stops like it seems that your android got hanged so if we sums up it let u and ur excitement to play with friends down poorly
84,ponnuvel s,1,"This game very cheeting. More than numbers of green colour but very very less than numbers of blue colour. Example ( one people start blue colour number is is 1 or 2, but next people start green colour is 6 and 6 and 6and 5 so always win for green colour selected people. Any time any time 6 and 6 and 5 but opposite blue colour choose the people 1 and 1and 1 and 2 very bad numbers"
85,Yash Verma,1,This game is clearly biased. It favours the person who have lost the past games in a row. Because they don't want to lose a player they make them win so they don't uninstall his useless game. Would have been fun if this wasn't biased!!!
86,Vijay Kumar,1,"Rubbished game that I have ever played. My experience with this game is worst. If you have free time, devote it to some other brain games. The dice is not at all random. It favors those, who make purchases of coins every time also favors the new players."
87,Arun Kumar,4,Why can't you enable voice chat ?your competitors like Ludo talent have implemented it. However your dice outcomes are in when compared to others which make the more interesting. It would be excellent if you implement voice chat.. pls to consider it and provide it ASAP.
88,Sathvik C,1,"The game which has no proper algorithm, and no idea how the dice are being hacked. Bloody if someone has more coins he/she will be the winner. Have some sence while you write code and algorithm. I'm sure some engineering dropout has smoked up and wrotr the code. Bloody anguuta chap chuts"
89,Vicky forever,1,Once you addict to this game then you can't able to win this game because am playing this game more then 1 month starting this game covering the everyone now days can't able to play my Die its was putting there way now worst to play getting irritating more now pls update new version this game.. This not computer fixing machine so update your future version its easy to install everyone. And lost more then 300k coin past weeks ago this great business for u :( making fool us all
90,Amish Shah,1,"I had a really bad experience. I had won and reached 5M coins but what happn thn i dont know. However good i play or how much I'm ahead in game, my last token will stay, i wont get the required no. on dice, n will never win,now i have no money, n never win no matter wht, even if i already have 3 tokens in home,n 1 remaining, n others hv all tokens out, i still loose. Plz take it seriously as i hv to play , coz every1 else around is playing. Plz revert n do something. Tell me if i cn do anything."
91,kishore potunuri,1,I had a worst experience with this app. Installed it for playing with friends but it's not at all connectting to server and if connected it is disconnecting after 2 minutes. I uninstalled and installed the app for 4 times but no change it made frustrated. So guys dont intsall this app.
92,meow meeow kitty,1,At first it's all fun but then. It's as if the game doesn't want you to win...my opponents keeps getting six and five while i get only one and three I don't suggest you take this game if you want a nice fun game with your friends
93,Sapna Pahwa,1,What the hell is wrong with this app.Every time I lose the game because I don't get 1 in the end the kind of frustration I feel every time I play this game.Because I know whether I'm ahead of everyone I am going to lose.And what is this When my token is ahead of opponent token he/she get exact same no. And capture my token like make your game realistic this is not at all possible in real life.If someone getting 6 they will get 6-6 till the end\U0001f624Hate this game uninstalling your app.
94,Faiq Patel,1,"Removed my previous rating after upgrade. If you are winning then you will get small numbers. If you require 1 to win, then you will get the big numbers continously and you will have to roll the dice 24 times to get 1. And they don't even reply."
95,Aishverya Jajoo,1,Don't download this game this is such a stupid game extremely biased.all the algorithms of the game work together to make an individual win. The dice itself isn't random at all. It is the most stupid game on the whole play store. Please don't make mistake of installing this stupidity on your phone.
96,Rohit naik,5,"Please add voice talk in ludo game.. one ludo company name called ""Yalla ludo"" in giving that features, so tat we can talk to opposite player.. However, in next update plz fix voice talk. So that, we can talk to each others and play ludo.. First tat feutures was In PubG..now it's in Yalla ludo. Now luking fwd in ludo king....plz fix it..."
97,bkc finance,1,Very fake game every thing is decided when we need 6 will get 1 or 2 every time.... if u earn more points u will every time loose the game for sure...pathetic game app i have ever seen will not recommend to anyone of my friend always opposite player win the game...it's irritates me a lottt
98,DIVYA ahuja,3,"Game is all good but the reason for giving 3 stars is that when your all 3 tokens are inside the home and you only need 1 to enter in the home for last token, you will definetly lose the game..1 will never come at the end. Please solve this issue...."
99,Himmat Singh Babel,1,The game disconnects from the internet after you receive and end a call. It is so frustating when the game gets disconnected in the middle. Don't know if everyone is facing this issue. But I am facing this issue on my redmi phone
100,KRISHAN GOYAL,1,It works on a fix algorithm. Mean you are going to lose every time because they want to show more and more ads to you so that you can earn some coins to play. Now it is your choise. There are a lot of ludo games on play store. Please prefer them.
101,sarika v manocha,2,"Hello guys, this is an incredibly timepass game but this game is a scripted game... it always makes you lose when you play a higher bid. It then becomes boring and then makes it wanna smash your phone. I would suggest to play some other game rather than this."
102,Gulafsha Praveen,3,"Hello, everybody loves to play ludo king undoubtedly it is awesome app made by developer,but as a user my experience is, it takes too long on splash screen for first and second screen...this is not encourageous so.. kindly give attention to that.Otherwise i enjoyed alot.Thanks:)"
103,Sachin Chaudhary,5,Ludo King is better than all other Ludo Apps. Simple and well defined structure i.e quite user friendly. Great efforts by Gametion team. My request : 5p & 6p option are available in offline mode - if you can open/make 5p option in play with friends(online mode).
104,Faith Garry,1,Algorithm sucks most of the time it supports new players to make them addicted mark my words devs improve it or see your app getting worst reviews day by day when you are about to win alorithm gona give you small numbers and your opponents gona get 5-6 and when your at final game gona stuck at 1 to make it look tough competition and when the lossing player is also near you he gona get big no.s
105,Gaurav Chaudhari,1,"Dear team, First of all great game made by you guys... Secondly it has started to be become predicatble like you have advantage initially and at the end picture is turned around. Thirdly now its like the game itself doesnt wants me to win straight more than 15 losses .... and in all games i was the closest to win.... this is not going through experience or anything as i have read other comments... but it sometimes feels like its determined at the end by the algorithm. PATHETIC NOW"
106,nikhil jc,3,"Lot of times if you need one(1) to win the game , it takes more than 10 turns,is that that difficult to get one at last satges,and some times it wont get more than one(1) ,while you are at enemy place(i seen lot of times).... Include voice chat..."
107,Pragaspathi SP,1,It's totally waste of time. They only decided the player who's gonna a win. U can't win continuosly. If they decided to u loss they give a big numbers to your opponent I realised it many times. It's wasted my time and it makes me irritating and disappointed.
108,Krishna CHaitanya,1,"Everytime you play a multiplayer online.this game just becomes so one sided.i just win so easy or Iose so easy.your dices and developers just suck.People play any game to win,fun and get some confidence out of it but this game and algos was designed by drunk douche.how come somebody win a game by having six consecutive 6's and I all I get is 1's.i hate it even if I get 6 6's in a row.t's just a useless game with stupid alogorithms.i am uninstalling it asap.FU game designers.not interesting atall"
109,syednadeem uddin,1,After seeing all the reviews I have also faced the similar scenario.. Of not getting the exact dice til your opponent who just started he will reach the home but i won't get 1 roll.. Looks like some opponent algorithm your roll will be... And it's not random developers
110,Viraj Mistry,1,"It was good in the beginning. Later it came out to be very biased. Once the algorithm is understood, it is very difficult to play in a fair way. Once we loose a game, it is a series of losses. I hope anyone can improve it."
111,Milan Panchal,1,Game is totally biased towards one player at a time. From starting of game you will come to know who will win. All dices favour that player. I think programming of this game is done by Mama Shakuni who want someone to win that game😆. Say thanks to google play we can't give you 0 or negative star.
112,ATANU KUMAR PAUL,1,"The algorithm of the program is not random, its biased. Ludo King decided the winner from the start of game. There is no scope to show your talent. We are playing this Ludo, because all other Ludo app on play store are worsen than this. Please try to improve the randomness of the algorithm."
113,alshahin alshahin,1,"you have to buy coin then you will winalways if you dont pay no win.its like cheetting game.when . Always Hanging.Very bad application, and game is fixed you cant win with people who have more rank only you can win with people who dont have good rank on this application you can win its like fixed who pay money for rank and money themy have more benefits.worst aplication no balancing at all only one pleyer have high number."
114,Ravi Sinha,1,It does not work on slow internet. And most irritating is that a simple game like ludo uses high ram consumption that it heat up mobiles whenever i play it on my device or on someone else's. If you make ram uses les then it will be more efficient.
115,mercy thotapalli,1,"AI or whatever algorithms used can be easily predicted and understood. I mean come on..... we know when exactly we get a six, guess?? When the opposite person come near our home..... seriously??unfair game and very disappointingly developed.. and especially we reach destination, we know who will win.. not so nice and random isint"
116,Abhishek Bahulayan,2,Horrible for those who are stuck at the end and waiting for either one or two. It never comes. My opponents all ran full court and won the game. I'm this a bug. Please fix this!
117,Blooming Flowers,1,"It is really annoying how at the end of any game , me and my friends always have to bring 1 to win . At first, i loved this game but now it is really annoying and i hate it 😡 don't download this annoying game😠"
118,Varsha Saha,1,"The game itself is a great game, but the dice isn't random at any rate. I agree with the other reviews that once you have reached certain number of coins you can not win and the dice goes against you."
119,Souvik Saha,1,One of the worst games i have played in recent times. Definitely this game is rigged. One can never win against the computer and moreover while playing with opponents most of the times the numbers are kind of rigged
120,Blondy Baron,1,It was my first game and. The other guy had the first move. He never played or game stuck. I dont know. I waited for like 5 mins and decided to give this review. And when i just went back to check the status of the game it said you lost. Pathetic!!!!
121,Harmanpreet Singh,1,It crashes😓. Please don't install this game. I recommend not to install this game😖. I have fully updated version of this game but it crashes. Please gametion fix this problem or it will be worse game ever. 😡 Thank you.
122,Madan Mohan Sharma,1,This game is good for about 2 to 3 weeks. But after it becomes very very irritating . One player gets many number of 6 . And always cut other player. Always get the advantage ..
123,Mandeep Jojo,1,One can identify the patterns of numbers coming in dice. Numbers are not random at all. Sixes can be easily predicted when it going to come. It feels like server decides the winner before the games starts.
124,Kiran Rawal,1,The only ludo game with themes.. so a star for that..after playing more than 100 times offline and online..i can tell you surely..that the person who has his 3 of them at finish..would be made to wait a lot knowingly at last round for last spawn.. making him frustrating and giving the opponent a thrilling experience and a chance to win.. eventually u will also lose many times.so overall experience is bad for gud players.even a kid can guess whats happening.
125,Reetu Sarma,1,It's really not fair. Learn something about probability and don't make the same algorithm for all the games. Why will I always finish with everyone when I'm much ahead from the start.
126,Aryan Manak,1,There are some negatives of this LUDO KING which are worst. 1-No token ever come to the same box(like in orignal LUDO game) 2- It mostly happens in this LUDO that opponent will win from the begining but your last token would stuck for No.1 3- In this LUDO token only opens on 6 rather it could be open on 1also & there must be separte chance for cutting opponent's token & 6 but in this those chances were merged into one instead of two chances.
127,Ashish Ramawat,1,"Once u reach a higher level or gains lots of coins u will keep on lossing irrespective of how good u play, u never get exact dice number but ur opponent who newly installed games will always gets exact dice number, even though ur tokens reach last step, not recommended at all."
128,Nauman Saiyad,1,"Don't pay anything to turn off ads. I paid Rs.80 and still getting ads. No difference. Also first I got few reply from team, and once I explained my problem with few mail and screen shot as they asked. Now they are not replying me at all.."
129,Libin Geevarghese,1,"Connection issue not fixed even after update.. and its a well planned game to make you win in begining stages anr gradually will make you lose all the games, all the coins and you are forced to buy ludo coins by paying real cash.... not interested anymore"
130,Gopal Dongsarwar,2,Very predictable and biased game. Opponents will always get required number to cut my tokens. Never let me win these days. Developer needs to change the algorithm of the game else they will loose the users very soon.
131,Kartik Singh Slathia,1,It's an awesome game but latest update is the worst ...one player always get 6 and the other player don't get any six as compared to other player .... otherwise this game is superduper for timepass...but if they fix this six issues it can be again better
132,Shiv Shankar Kumar,4,"It's a really nice game, we can play with friend or family or if you don't have some one you can also play with computer. It also has snake and ladder. One problem that is sometimes it is biased with dice. Except that I love this game. 😊❤️"
133,yash verma,1,Stupid algorithm .. if the algo decides your token to b cut down it will give you 1 repeatedly 4 times 5 times untill your token is not cut .. and many times when you need 1 to win .. keep on rolling you won't get even after rolling the dice 15-20 times.
134,Rajan Kumar,2,I m win 1 time and lose 4 time I recorded this moment. If any time chance to win but i cannot Many time my last goti in house but opponent 2 or 3 goti out side that time i lose the match it repeat in 7 time of 10 times. Please fix all type bug or program cause it make game boaring.
135,Siddhant,1,This Game has a Server which goes down every 10-15 mins. The Game takes a lot of time (turns) to kick an AFK Player. The Game has a Lot of Glitches some of which cause the game to crash. This game is an Absolute Waste of Time.
136,Md Shabaz,1,Sick creator always wants guest to win ! you can only enjoy with your friends dont play online specially with guest players AI is set it will be one sided. I have experienced it by playing both sides . Better download other app.
137,Riya Samanta,2,Everything about the app is awesome.. but the server connection error doesn't allow you to play in the first place... Doesn't matter how good your network connection is!!!
138,Rajat Bhatia,1,Today i was about to win my 3 tokens Went inside only 1 was left and my opponents were far behind me and then the game of fixing starts my opponent players getting exact number to cut my token and guess what i lost the match.The game is totally fixed the dice doesn't show random numbers.
139,Dhaval Ramanuj,2,it's good to pass time. but algorithm of game is badly scripted while you play online. that's why it deserves 2 star only. obviously game is too much popular and there is no effect of -ve review.but it's fact.
140,Partha Pratim Nandy,1,"Too bad app, stuck sometimes. Also there is a trick if you do not play for few days then you will get good score. Some algorithm works here. Draining the battery very fast."
141,irfan shaikh,1,This is the worst ludo game I have ever played in my life the algorithm of numbers are so pathetic that you will rage and will broke your phone everytime your goti is about to cut your opponent will come with exact number and when you are about to cut your opponent goti they will never give the exact number not in infinity chances this is a just waste time and has gained popularity because people have nothing to do nowadays If someone will ask me which is the worst app ludo king will win
142,ashwani kumar,1,"They control the game. The dice nos. are not random. It will roll in such a way that game remains competent. 1. Whenever game is about to fiinish, likely winner will get 1's in each roll and the other guy will get 6's and cut. 2.You will never see three 6's and your coins coming on top of each other in open lane. 3. 9 out of 10 times when you move infront of someone else's home, it will give him desired no &will kill your coin... It makes the game intersting but again output is being controlled."
143,Abhi Pereira,1,"Nothing random about the numbers on the dice. If you go ahead someone with a crown, he/she will get the right number and kill you. Whereas, if you even chase behind someone with a crown you won't kill him/her ever and that person will land on a star for sure. This is rigged for sure. On an actual physical board, the odds are way better."
144,tejashri Vichare,1,"Very bad experience, when open the game then under maintains notification is displayed. Very bad experience. It's fixed game. When I played then it's like haked game. Very bad software. Change this issue."
145,Kishwer Ahmad,1,This game is fixed and chances of your win or loss is predetermined. Dice roll is not random at all. You will keep losing once you cross 100000 coins. Don't waste your time playing online.
146,Nemish Shah,3,"The experience is frustrating.The algorithm is so rigged that somehow after we get a six and move ahead,the player behind gets a number to knock us out .This is not competition.This is called frustrating user interface."
147,BINAY KRUSHNA KARAN,1,"This the worst game ever played in my life . The dice roll numbers are pre programmed and are not random at all and it is previously decided who is the winner of that match also. So kindly don't waste your time , data and your brain for playing this non logical and nonsense games ...."
148,Gopal Tiwari,1,Stupid game made with absolutely no sense like if you don't know how to make a game then don't make one and don't waste people time and effort and what is this all about if two tokens are close to each other if you try to touch one the other one moves automatically and the game currently turns up side down seriously really disappointing game and on that it's filled with adds on every step of the game Please don't download it I'm giving one star but don't even deserve that\U0001f44e\U0001f44e\U0001f44e\U0001f44e\U0001f44e\U0001f44e\U0001f44e\U0001f44e\U0001f44e\U0001f44e\U0001f44e\U0001f44e

150,Anirvan Sarkar,3,"When the block in board blinks it distracts, animation could have been better, it feels like the game is going too fast to understand or think. That's all."
151,Boss Gamer,1,I am losing Everytime \U0001f620\U0001f620 it favour either girl player or opponent get 6 on dice as i go up in left corner.its not coincidence it happened 10 times dont intall it better play pubg it lags but there is no partiality i am uninstalling the game and will never download it and i will be on my words the game developer deserves abuses but i am forced to maintain my status.
152,ashish antony,1,It quite obvious the game algorithm is slows the play when you are ahead. Sometimes it takes ages to get six so that you can start the game. Number on the dice are not random.
153,kishan chauhan,1,Worst game. Worst means worst. And I uninstalled this game. You never win after too many attempts and only time wasting and don't even win in that double reward. Just a time waste game. I wish I can give -5 star for this game.
154,Aman Jain,1,Very worst experience instarting i feel gud and while play with my frnd but after some time i feel this is biased game approx 6-7 time continiously same thing happend eith me while i need only 1 and opponent have 2 token and she win easily and i m waites for 1 which is never come. Worst game ever 6-7 time its not my bad luck app is fake
155,Aditya Menon,2,The game is good in some what ways... But when its time to end the game it gets stuck to 1 positions..... I've lost so many matches because of that stupid algorithm that you have put.... Please fix it I am begging you
156,Find Amarok,3,"These days their's a bug hapoening, Place where if your Coin Cover some other person Coin tge other person that coin back to home, but now its not happeing due to smoething don't know what. Team please check ur app. And the speed become very slow."
157,Shankar Kashyap,3,Connectivity Problem when playing with 4 or more . You have to Rectify this connectivity Problem otherwise people will stop using your Game so many Chinese Games are waiting but Plz correct this whenever 4 people play online it shows network problem always though my network is best.
158,Monika Salve,5,Really good app and has brought my childhood days back and definitely a boon in the Lockdown. The best part is that you can play with your friends online. Thanks Gametion team!!!
159,Bijoy Krishna banik,1,"The stupidest game I ever played. It's completely rigged and always favors 1 player over other. If there was an option of negative rating, I would have given that. Don't play."
160,Medhavi,1,I love this Game but it hangs so much !!!! I've lost around 70000 amount of virtual money coz it hangs at the wrong time. Played a game by exiting it after every chance n resuming it to avoid hanging.
161,Rutvik Dhami,3,Add some useful features like online 6 Players game with friends (by creating room which is there in 4 players right now) and team up feature in online games with friends should be there. That's all.
162,Seena Chandru,1,I just need one 1 to win the match but i didn't get a 1 for straight 18 rolls and the others won. Never seen 18 rolls without a 1. How unfair. Hate this game. High level players always wins. Fix this. Make the rolls random.
163,Vijay Pandey,1,Thirs class game ......... whenever you close to win you will not get whatever you want ......third class.....never download again ....PUBG is the best atleast there is no nonsense thing......just tell me everyone rateing only single star then how it's possible 4.2.. its fake you guys are showing......there is not respond form team ....have checked your rating ...what do you think guys people are fool...edits game ...there is no option for 0 rate
164,The Trailblazer,1,Every time game is pre planned by app and dice are totally biased. Algorithm is very bad. App always decides who will win. We can always predict the conclusion of the game. Game is not all interesting.
165,Shah Begum,1,One of the worst games ever!! Everytime I get killed because I'm in front of the opponent and the dice probably not even random. I would rather play the real life version.
166,Sufia Faruqi,1,Worst experience... This is biased. Like hell.. why my token is beaten every time.. pathetic. Dice is not randomly rolled. Its fixed. Only one person keeps on winning. Disgusting..😡😡 pathetic game.
167,Tushar gaddalay,1,"Application is stuck. I found a bug in the application, I have the screen shot. All the other 3players left the match but the application still asks me to play the dice. This is crazy"
168,shirsendu kandar,1,Just waste of time...we generally play games just to fresh our mind or to be Happy but believe me after playing this u will be frustrated and sad..at first your experience gonna be fine..but then u keep loosing everytime it seems to be scripted ..
169,Iaidbiang Marwein,1,Don't waste your time you can only win if you play with 500 bet not more than that. Is a shameful game. Players are fake and fixed. Always asked to buy. I don't like a worse game and I deleted.
170,Mansi Tanwar,3,"I like this game very much only one reason for 3 star is that at the end of the game we don't get the ""one"", and the dice also are not random."
171,Shatakshi Sinha,1,"I don't wanted to give this app 1 star but the problem in this game is the ""7 up down"" (a challenge) I never ever win this game challenge..and also I spent more than half of my money in this so that acha now I will win now I will win..but no I never won this challenge"
172,Tajuddin Qureshi,4,Very happy about this game\U0001f60d\U0001f9e1Coz it is very useful for TP and I never get bored while playing this\u2763\U0001f49e\U0001f493 The best game I've ever seen nd played \U0001f970\U0001f929 The problem is while playing online the opposition will get high numbers and they win the match so it is irritating nd we r not able to beat them as they beat us Rubbish \U0001f623\U0001f62b
173,Pavan Hemanth,1,"I think winners of the game is decided at the beginning of the game,only he gets big numbers and chance to kill opponent after he finishes the game the second winner which was decided first only now gets big numbers and killing chances.Algorithm problem exists"
174,Kakkireni Sriharsha,4,Awesome and interesting game but iam hoping to add the voice call option to comunicate with otehers becouse i usually play this game by my family they to suggested for voice chat so iam requesting to add ans voice chat option i think this game may be developed a lot if it will be kept
175,Jay Mudgal,1,"This problem started after buying chips from them, hence I would request everyone to stop buying chips because they will make you lose & buy more chips from them.This app is so biased that I can't tell you. People are getting 6 again again like hell ... In my on an average I get less than 3."
176,Pamela Chakraborty,1,I think it's a tricky app as the players who have scored pretty well before but those who r newly joined the scope is not given to the new game.Always the winner gets the chance to win not the new one.
177,Sana Rahman,1,"It was working fine few days back and just now when I was playing for 5k, I lost control of my movements. I won but didn't receive the coins as well. Whats wrong?"
178,Puja Sinha,5,"Loved it ! If there would have conference call option on play with friends option, then I think it will be more fun. Just a suggestion!"
179,Tejpal Kaur 024,5,This game is very good but I think this game is planned that it only make winner to that person which it want or it may be about luck also but it's good for time pass and also in lockdown it's really fun in playing this game whoever win I don't care
180,utsav kumar,1,The worst game scenario they have in the game. Whenever you will play this game suddenly it shows that no network Even in the wifi. And this is fix that who will win the match. Why need to play this manipulative game.
181,margret meshy,3,This app is biased and predictable. That was still okay but it has started to hang and we have to uninstall it and install it again because of that issue.
182,Rachana Sinha,1,Rigged biased game. For instance if a player has least no. Of coins and is about to be broke he/she wins the game. Or all the moves are so to make the game interesting and not fair. Uninstalling rn. :/
183,Manjit Kaur,5,I am having a great experience by playing this game. I am enjoying a lot. Please help us to earn more coins. It's my humble request . I am having a problem regarding playing. mayani Ludo king is not working properly.
184,Umesh Gupta,2,This game is fixed. It will make you loose the game if you are winning position. This is not my opinion it's of many people who are using this app. Still it's a great time pass.
185,Sai Kumar,1,Your gaming system worst.. not in equalizing..you fix the winner of game is before starting. Equalize. And winner is take winning for their own risk.. but u give one sided dice roll. If u fixed the winner they get. What they need u give more..
186,Ayush Purohit,4,"This is very good game but there is one problem that when we play online, the game starts lagging... So i hope you will take quick actions."
187,Prakaash Nichani,1,"The worst, most disgracefully manipulative game I have seen. Pls install other ludo apps instead. The computer will give you numbers just to increase screen time. Pls play only if you want to feel like a kite in the storm. Goes against the very fundamentals of a game."
188,Simran seth,2,So much scripted . Once you have a lot of coins you are the only one to loose because of the makers. Total waste of time and playing with interest of people hate it for this kinda script
189,Ashish Murmu,2,What the hell is going on. This game is battery eater. A online game costing me 10% battery drain. Are you kidding me !!! Even pubg match doesnt eat battery like this. Very bad experience.
190,Prathamesh Padwal,1,"Been losing 95% of the times I've played this game. And it's been 7 months. Are you guys even listening? The randomizer works in favour of my opponent almost EVERY SINGLE TIME, irrespective of colour, strategy and time of the day. Don't give me bullsh*t explanation now"
191,Sanjal Shahi,1,I am not supposed to give this game even 1 star I was played a match with online players atleast 5 times and I won only 1 match and in every match it seems that every match is fixed in my last match my all the 3 gotis were in and my my opponent has his 2 gotis inside the box which were not even came out and he won the match and my only 1 goti was left of which I was to get only one but I didn't get so finally I am uninstalling the game\U0001f620\U0001f620\U0001f620\U0001f44e\U0001f44e\U0001f44e\U0001f595\U0001f595\U0001f595\U0001f595\U0001f595
192,Himanshu Gaur,1,"This is the worst game because this is the fixed game who will win is decided i have seen many games only those people win who have more coins or points, this is biasness, shame on you people atleast dont spoil the name of the best game of childhood worst experience."
193,Manikandan D,1,Always the opponent gets the highest number in dice. Most of the times i get only 1 and 2. This is obsolutely ridiculous. I started hating this game nowadays.
194,Abhishek Jha,1,Fukd up rigged game with Bots/Fixed Players. Played 2-3 games of 50K. Always got the same player named Aryan with same profile image. It's a bot. You rarely get a 6 on dice and that player gets 6 every alternate roll. Additionally their dice rolls perfect numbers to kill your coins and there is a time where their all 4 coins are nearing home and your all 4 are yet to start. It was fun but now the developers are only looking to make money. It's frustrating now.
195,ashok Kumar,5,"It is very good game I ever played. But if you can adopt it and can add voice recording like ludo comfun, then from my side it is the world's best game."
196,Rejani Suresh,1,The most ludicrous and stupidest dice! The rolling of the dice is not random at all but rather cunning and manipulative. This game is extremely biased. Totally disappointing. A huge thumbs down. 👎🏼
197,Eshank Gupta,1,"This game always get stuck on certain numbers.. mostly making the game interesting, uses algorithm to manipulate dice. Last round gets close enough always and keeps the player stuck on 1."
198,Dulal Roy,2,At the beginning I liked the app very much....it used to keep me happy......but nowadays when I start playing the game...when my turn comes it becomes auto.....so I gave two stars
199,Prachi Dhir,1,"It's rigged. Exactly what is needed to kill appears way too often. I can predict it. Bug: if u roll 6 on the first turn, the game freezes and u loose a turn. Also wastes time and people keep yelling Play Fast! Please fix"

206,Aman Chutani,1,"It's the worst game ever, donot download it, the dice is totally fixed. You will not win on the basis of your luck. You can only win that day when its the choice of this game."
207,Anshul Agrawal,1,Very worst game. While in the mission to win continuously 2 or 3 times at the last match and at the last moment I defeated every time because of irrelevant numbers on the dice.
208,HARISH KASHYAP,5,Very good app. Please provide mic and speaker so we can talk with each other . Otherwise we have to put our phones on conference with our buddies.

211,Mohammed Sarwar Shaikh,1,Really partial games...i got the pattern...it gives every color 3 game to win in series..i.e. if blue wins 3 games..then it gives another color 3 chances..and during that time that color numbers are very powerful
212,Aman Agrawal,1,"Never ever install this game. Whenever you put money on stake you lose. Terrible algorithm. Seriously frustrating. There are many other games, install them."

224,Abhishek Bhatia,1,Very poor application. Winning coins are deducted automatically. They are just making fool of customers . Would request all to not waste time on this . Today more than 50 k coins has been deducted.

230,Moula S,1,Worst app I have never seen before and ever it's already pree programmed to the opponent side even we tried several times it behaves another way it's worst app. Don't install it. It's waste of time.It play with our emotions.Worst worst worst. Biased game app.

241,Aesthetic Aurora,1,I wd most likely give it a zero. Its the worst app in the history of gaming apps. Like once its will give u the chance to win n its totally dependent on who has the more coins. If a person has more coins then that person will win for sure nomatter wht. I just wanna delete this super cringy & obnoxious game
242,Anindita Dash,3,I love playing Ludo in ludoking... But suddenly it started crashing my one plus 7 phone... I have all the memory in my phone. High end games run very smoothly.. but this game lags. Please help

244,Anjali Mathew,1,The game is totally biased. It forces us to collect more coins in order to win. If the coins are less then it wont let us win the game.
245,Aman Shaikh,1,"Totally scripted game , when we going to win suddenly all tokens are captured by other players . Totally waste of time . Don't install it ."
246,anuj baghel,1,It's seems to be predetermined victory of the opponent....it totally worst game...Dice algorithm would be same for all the players but actually it is predictable about the win
247,Ayushmaan Kaul,1,Please update the algorithm of this game as it gets heavily biased against one out of 4 players in general which I think is unfair.. And I am that one player most of the times

262,ja3 gambhir,1,"I am not able to login using my Facebook Credentials.It's shows ""Trying to connecting Server"". What d hell is going on? Will I get any response from developer team or not?"

264,Nayan Puj,1,"Die is rigged, design in a such a way that you can't win after achieving certain number of coin. No matter how hard you try. Developer's claim of random number is just a lie. Super evil corporate lie."
265,Vibha,1,Worst game of the century 👎 i wish there is a chance to give negative stars. All no. Are autogenerated. One player got 6 continuously and the other one got least no. Such a biased game i ever seen.
266,Sanjay,2,Every time I open this app it is crashing and not running smoothly ... I don't know that it is my phones complaint...It is very lagging ..and crashing

They are having opposition person from there own team. I asumed in several occation."
272,Sibi Reji,4,I like this game very much. But one problem is that i will only get 1 in dice in online multiplayer so you should improve the random dice session
273,rhea okhandiar,1,This game targets you....even though you are about to win and everyone else is far behind ...some how you'll loose in the end and come last ....this is a unfair game 😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬....the app is rigged ..eventhough no cheat code have been used
274,DEVALKUMAR TANK,1,Phone gets too much heated A ridiculous game ever seen.Player with lower level and coins than us always wins very very easily. Dice always gives point according to their need. Please don't waste time in playing this game. Worst of the worst one.
275,Vipul Chanania,1,Worst app... always hangs and doesnt work ....first of all everytime other player got number and i have not received any type of number... please fix this bugs otherwise it is worst app
276,Dr .Manisha Amte,5,Awesome game . But there is suggestion that can you increase the no.of players from four to five or six when we play ludo with our friends .
277,Alok Advani,1,Works on algorith.. it decide whether it wants you to win or not. Most of the ludo games are like this only.. these are programmed in a way that it decides who to win or who not to win..
278,HANA jeba sudha,5,"Hey there ludo king, this is a awesome game for awesome players the options are wow... And the thing is you don't only have ludo but too snakes and ladder ,nice there things real awesome"

282,Kuntala Das,4,This is very nice. And I like this game very much 😊I think in the time of lock down it is the good way for time pass 😂
283,Hasin Qureshi,1,"This game is completely terrible. As complained by most of the other players, the dice is biased. It is not at all a natural experience playing as the game always gives same probability to win or lose. If you win 2 matches continously, then u will surely lose the third time. Also, there are various players who are too disturbing. While playing, they annoy you by sending stickers and messages.I suggest you to fix the game and make it a more natural experience for the players."
284,yogesh charkari,1,Can't play online this game .. if you disconnect your network . This game can't access your network you automatically disconnect your play.. and you lose your bet
285,Shoveyi Keyho,5,"Very good game. Fun to play with friends online. Moreover, timepass together with family and friend offline."
286,hariprasad bekal,1,After latest update app keeps crashing. Sent the logs but no improvement. There are better apps which handles users in a better way.

288,Sukhman Sidhu,5,iam playing from year and i get 1000 only of every match and i am getting no rewards when level up. please solve my problem and give me 10000000 rs. or other iwise i will feedback your game. I will do complaint about this on social media.
289,Manab Das,4,"Overall the game is amazing, but one feature that is lacking is ingame voice chat. That'll make this more realtime"
290,Suraj Mishra,1,There is no random numbers ... It has been already fixed most annoying game ..... Improve your coding so that no should be random not in fixed manner.
291,Saigal Michael,1,This game is some kind of a bug...to my phone...not working properly...gets hanged while starting the online multiplayer...and my opponent wins.... please do the needy
292,kishore,1,The problem is not in game the real problem is this app consuming 30 to 40 percent of my battery which is heating and damage my phone so battery consumption must be rectified
293,Kalyani Patil,1,This is baddest app ever n always will be 😬 I loved this app when I installed it for the first time but now I hate it. It unsatisfactory ever nowadays 👎 I really don't wanna rate this app even a half star but it'll not accept my review if i don't rate a single star
294,Mahera Varsha,1,"Hi ludo this is my alltime favourite game..... I always play with my friends...family members,online friends.....

295,Chandra Bhushan singh 998,1,The worst app ever don't download it and waste ur time. Every thing is planned before who will win and it also lags in between. The worst game I have ever played in my life
296,suBOSS Chandar,3,"This game should have the option of chatting using our voice from one end to other, it would be more fun"
297,Yash Khatri,1,The game is biased and the algorithm is flawed. It clearly picks one player over other and helps the player win. I hope the game developers understand the concept of probability of dice outcomes. It's basic math. Please get it correct. 6 friends of mine including me have uninstalled this app. Note to the developer: Please don't respond with a generic answer that the dice outcomes are purely random. Because it's not. We users understand what's going on.
298,komal bandle,3,"I just wanted to say that it would be great if there is voice chat available as well. It gets harder to play and type at the same time and meaningless. So if there's voice chat available that would be great. I really love this game. It's quite simple and doesn't have extra nuisance, user friendly and easy on eyes. I'll change my ratings to 5 once the facility is added.Thanks"
299,Mohamed Hanifa,1,"This game good, time the dice is favour for paid players, not random, new players cant go further, players those who buy in sale the dice is favour for them..."
300,Karan Moolchandani,3,It should have option for group play while 4 players are playing such that diagonally opposite players form one group or team. That will be very cool
301,Shruthi Venkatesh,1,"NOT RANDOM AT ALL!!!!!! IF YOU THINK YOU ARE WINNING, THE GAME MAKES IT LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO WIN. I NEEDED TO ROLL 3 FOR A FINISH AND IT TOOK ME 17 TRIES TO GET IT. I COUNTED IT. THIS GAME IS BS. NOTHING CAN BEAT THE TRUE AND ORIGINAL BOARD GAME. THE GAME WITH RANDOM PLAYERS OR A GROUP IS ALL BASED ON SOME ALGORITHM AND IS NOT TRULY AS RANDOM AS ITS SUPPOSED TO BE.... ONE PLAYER GETS 6 A MILLION TIMES WHILE THE OTHER NADA...DONT EVEN GET ME STARTED ON THE SNAKE AND LADDER GAME, SMH!!!!"
302,NEHAL PANCHAL,2,There are so many bugs while creating and joining the Room. Look in to this matter.
303,Ashok Prajapati,1,100% scripted game. Worst game I have ever played. Dice roll is not random. Biased game.
304,vidhya selvaraj,1,They purposely target one player in the game...and favor the one who is gonna win...and that is so obvious...more then streebuster its a game that gives stress...it should have a fair dice play...
305,sudeept jaiswal,1,Pathetic game app.. Uses pathetic algorithm to make it more time engaging. It's all particularly for the business they are making and nothing for entertainment as should be primary for games.
306,Thushyanthy Jeevarasa,5,Nice game.. start from today I can't open my game it's showing .. accept all domains some thing like that.. please advise me how to solve this. Thank you
307,Zameer Ali,1,"When signed in with FB and when I select play online it just keeps showing me connecting to server (updated app, network connection every thing is OK)"
308,Sujata Biswal,1,Biased unfair game. This game is so biased that I had to write this review. First 10-15 times the die seems to be in favour almost in every game and you feel like \u201cLudo King\u201d. I encountered many quitters who just get irritated and leave. I try to be patient even when I lose. However things change almost suddenly when you have reached a balance of around 20-25k coins. Once you have reached level 6-7 it shows it\u2019s real side. 6 is rarely on your die and most of the time it came 1 or 2s.
309,balaji gowda,2,The dice is not random ....I believe it equalizes all players and then throws random numbers....don't install it if u think this game is played through luck...
310,Karan Pandit,1,"I had uptaded this app but, Still facing *connecting to server error*,not able to play online multiplayer and spin wheel ,play with Friend ""connecting To server error"""
311,Nitesh Dhal,3,"Why their r too many updates in this?? whenever their will b any match, this shit comes up with an update.Sometimes ""play with friends"" doesn't open.settle these problems asap"
312,Megha Chauhan,1,This game...always...cheats with me...i always loose the game...the opponent always....receive good numbers and on my chance...i cant receive any good numbers...😡😡😡😠😠😠😠 I just hate this game...
313,sumer singh,1,Not even a single Star. I think all the reviews are absolutely right.A Few days ago I updated this new version .I could not win even a single game out of nine games. Even I am facing same problems. Every time I think I am about to win I lose. This game always favours same person constantly. So there are some issues to be fixed very soon.
314,Karim Labbai,1,Hi.. From Afternoon onwards game was lagging and there is some glitch whenever i started game.. It's hang middle of some where.. Fix this issue soon.. Or m Going to Uninstall
315,Khush Jajoo,1,Lots of bugs in the game. Game keeps crashing even after the latest update.
316,Masum Ahmed,3,The only thing is that when you don't need a number it will always pop up but when you do need that number it will never come and you end up losing
317,aakash naagar,5,Amazing developers you are just amazing but I have to say something that you can add an option that show how many buddies of opponent in online mode
318,sriya agrawal,1,Worst game ever...😡all the gamesa are pre planned and always they do cheating😡😡plzzz don't install this app if u want to play fair game😡😡they always gives corrrct dice to my opponent and never give me proper dice...😡how's it possible that always my opponents are winning😡😡☺
319,Piyush Kumar,1,"I hated this game because whenever I played, I always lost and sometimes when I am winning the game then networking problems occur"
320,Shashank shekhar mishra,2,It was working fine previously. But it is hanging repeatedly now. Please fix the issue. Mobile: Realme X
321,investment studies,1,Dice roll is fixed . Not completely random. Great example is I still haven't seen 3 back to back 6 on dice roll
322,Zaid Khan,1,Such mean game when one person is winning why Ludo king come give other person numbers to beat the opponent if someone had needed only one number to win the game and suddenly Ludo king started to give big numbers to other person which is not good
323,Karthick Dinakar,3,Lot of bug prblm! Even though there is proper internet connection i still have prblm in game . It automatically ejects me out.
324,Pratik Shukla,1,Worst game server every we are waiting for our turn to play and your network lag is throw out of the game and it shows you left the game...What the hell is this??
325,QuaranTuber,1,"""THE DICE JUST DOESN'T ROLL RANDOMLY"" ..which makes this game totally unfair. Just think about this..your strategy won't make anyyy difference at all, instead it's completely dependent upon the computer whether it will let you win or lose. I know with 100% accuracy when my opponent would get a six or when my token would be captured for sure. It's that BAD. Rest assured, THIS GAME WILL GIVE YOU HEIGHTS OF FRUSTRATION AND DEPRESSION instead of giving joy. Good Luck !!"
326,Rakesh Kumar,1,"Really bad experience, my friends also stopped playing this game, because of 1 number dice bug at winning time."
327,Purti Sharma,1,Sometimes it loooks like a fixed game.. it never gives the required number opponent gets the exact required number.. why so??
328,tushar sarvagod,1,Worst update I guess. The play is being played automatically online and not responding at all. Worst app to play online.
329,Sanjana Patnaik,5,A very good game with afcorss good graphics. The best thing about it is that we can play with family and friends....☺☺☺☺
330,neha rawat,1,"Very bad experience, fixed game..it will let you win for the first time then you will lose every other time.."
331,Sunita Junawa,1,"What sort of a game is it? All matches are fixed. However, you may try but still you are going to lose the match. Like seriously? What's wrong with you guys? Let it be a fair match! Only if you guys know the meaning of fair. I wouldn't have given it a one star rating but guess what I had to so that i could leave a review about your unethical, unfair ludo king."
332,Umar Shaikh,5,It very good game for time pass very peoples are playing this game because of Qurantine if corona virus spreads for more days I hope it will cross the pubg and main thing The pubg lover also play this game day n night but main problem of this game is gogle sign is not availble i request the makers to add gogle sign in my family not allow to use fb thats why Thx you
333,Smitha Nandagopal,4,It is a very nice game which can be played for passing the time.... It also very challenging and heartbreaking game
334,Happy Khosa,1,"Used to be a good game to pass time with family and friends. But it is not a game of chance for sure as it was supposed to be. I guess some algorithms are required to keep the game interesting, but the fact that the game is manipulated seems very obvious. Changing the review to 1. The games are so tiring now days. The code manipultes every move so that all players finish at the same time. We were so bored in the last game, we stopping capturing opponent tokens to just finish the game!!"
335,\ua8ba\u0e2a\uaaddiL \ua8ba\uaadd\u0e2a\u0e2c\uaac0L,1,This is the worst game I have ever played. My opponents gets 6 again and again but I don't it doesn't give me 6 and If I make a room it doesn't support me and my friends take all coin away from me. It was working good when I played it 1st time and then it showed it's real look. Whenever I get in my home and I need only 1or2 to win it doesn't give me that and it let's my opponent to win I am so irritated by this game this is scripted. It won't support u If your level is low than another player.\U0001f92c
336,Dayanand Kumar,1,"Hello sir, you can add features like direct voice contact in ludo, like other app is doing,this would be great if you will consider our points 🙏"
337,Alket Alk,1,The game is fixed. When you reach a lot of coins never get the exact dice and keep loosing.
338,Hrishant O,1,"The new arrow system sucks, why this arrow keep directing the turn, we are mature enough to understand who's next, please remove the arrow indicator, it's annoying and disturbing"
339,EKTA JAIN,1,I dun understand y this app is making fool of people Completely biased game and a complete waste of time..there is a point i am not getting any six and my opponent continuously getting six definitely that person will win i got six in the end nonsense stupid game stupid app developer
340,Misbah Arefin,1,This Game is biased. At early play people wins most. And after that u will lose badly. There r something fix in this game. The dice is fixed by the developer. They want u loose the game and after loosing ur coins u want coins. For this there add instantly displays on screen after evering lost game. People are being fooled by this game. After earning 4lakha coins u starting loosing most of the matches. But when i installed app from another mobile. I used to win every play.
341,divyesh patel,5,"Ludo king is amazing game, we played lot in this lockdown period . Thanks for giving such amazing childhood back during this covid19 👍 Now i m facing problem in geting number of 6 !! Is it why i rated your application and gives 4 star rate!"
342,yogesh kumar,1,The app keeps on crashing and hanging in one plus devices( may be android 10 issue). Just not able to play anymore
343,siva prasad,1,"Game is good , but now am facing issue that is app is closing every 1min..even in mid of game and restarting ...not able to play game"
344,ANJANA MEHTA,1,Not able to connect the game from past 3 days....it's really horrible...have updated the app too....still it's only showing connecting server
345,Tech factz,4,"Awesome game , but this can be improved and more kind of features should be added."
346,Nisha Gupta,1,"After complaining of bad network. Now my numbers is not coming. And my button is not working. Plz check Again after complaining, the network is good but ludo is not working. When I play the game of small amount then the network is good, but when I play for large amount , it always make me run out. Really bad experience. Plz check."
347,jhanvi verma,5,I like this app a lot.... Would like to give you a suggestion....if you can Put audio for playing with frnds options it will be awesome....
348,Dr.Ashutosh Mundhava,4,The new update of this game is nice and issues fixed. The internet connection issues are solved now Thanks !
349,DHAVAL PATEL,3,instead of chat option... provide voice option in play with friends game..so everyone cam talk with our buddies 🤞.its better idea to update
350,Kruthika Raj,1,Never play their missions. The make you sure you lose all your coins .its a trap. They make sure you lose those games.
351,Avi Dugar,1,Worst Game AI I have ever seen...... Haven't won a single game in 21 attempts. How is this possible.
352,Nishant Jha,3,The algorithm is totally biased and favours generally singke player. Too much of coincidences and forethought by AI to favour one player.
353,Madugula bhanu Bhanu,1,I hate this game because when opponents kill every dies when we r goings to win the opponent will get exact number to kill our token and we not get that game they will win not we improve that first
354,silky bhadauria,1,"Earlier I found it interesting, but the fact is this game is all designed the way that you cannot get random no. It's all fixed, it can't let you win until other players comes equal to you and also it makes other player getting the same no. at which our token gets stopped ..this is all ridiculous.. everything is so deliberately designed.. worst game ever. I gave 5 stars initially but now changing it to 1 and wish there was a option to chose 0 I would have given zero and would never recommend"
355,Santhosh Ramesh,1,The dice throw doesn't look random .. it biased... It almost follows a pattern on how it wants to make a player lose ..
356,Priyal Dervankar,1,The worst game whenever I play with computer I win but whenever I play with friends I loose why is it so all fixing I'll never play if this is gonna happen again I everytime loose u matchfixers
357,Munna Mobile,3,I am facing heating issue with this game and also battery drains very fast using this app. please resolve. Thank you
358,Janvi Bajaj,1,"This game is so unfair. Very disappointed. The last game i played, the opponent keeps on getting 6's on their dice. Me on the other hand, never even got a chance to put my coins on the board. Even if i manage to get one out, the opponent will get the exact number that i got and easily puts me back to where i started. I've had this experience lots of time. And I've decided this would be my last time. So i uninstalled this fake game. Honestly guys don't waste your time."
359,Legend Gaming,1,I have given only one star to this game because the developers of this game are very big fools . In this game if you play pass N play then it will definitely support only one player . I have played 59 times pass N play with my brother by taking the same color all the 59 times and every time my brother won . So I request the developers of this game to work on this problem \U0001f621\U0001f621\U0001f621
360,Hasan_boss26,1,"It's a good game to play but it's stupid ,especially when u are near the end. I needed a 1 to win and and the other players still had to go round twice, then it let them do that and it let 1 person win then it gave me the 1 after all that time. This game used to be good now it just gives so much unfair numbers. it won't give u wat u need to win and it let's other people go to the end b4 that. Also I've lost alot of coins just cos the game has let the opponentwin by always giving em wat dey need"
361,AKshay Shukla,1,Just now played another 2 player game. Played brilliantly. Needed 1 at last to win the game. Didn't get 1. Whats more surprising is that the opponent's two tokens were locked. He opened both of them. Crossed the board and won the game by putting both of them to home. And i was still waiting for that 1 to come. I rolled almost 30 chances but didn't get 1. And thats not the first time this has happened. Its almost every time. I get a lot of 1 throughout the game but not when i need it to win.
362,hidayu hassan,2,"Just basic layout board, no graphic whatsoever. Does offer different gameplay and online players but feels not complete."
363,PUNJABI YOUTUBER,1,This is very bad I updated my software to android 10 and my game got a random account and I can't access my main account it had 1 million coins and I even made a payment on that account I mailed from in-game and got no reply
364,R\xe3j\xeash V,1,Do not download this game and do not waste your time to play this type of pre designed game. This app doesn't deserve even single star. I observed alot of times at the end point when we require one or 2 number dice it doesn't display and at the same time the opponent can reach to destination from starting point to end point. The match winner is initially decided in this APP program. Also this type of algorithm make us mentally to play the game again and again. Guys do not edict on this game much
365,Abhishek Sen,1,Worst experinces. I suggest u to download another aap. The main thing is its all depend on auto strategy. It doesn't matter how better ur playing. The worst experince is it doesnt give the opponent a chance to win at the last moment when the player is with 1 and opponent is 2. Its only following auto strategy so as to make this aap more intresting. But i must say. Bad strategy worst planing nd empty mind. Go hell with this aap.
366,jst ricks,1,"Worstttttttt!!!!!!! All reviews are true. I trued playing so many times but everytime disheartned. Game stucks suddenly, stops even after moving my buttons .. and suddenly... You ran out of time!!! And here my turns also gone red for no reason... Always stucking at any stage... And also the negative reviews given, i am facing the same. While playing, somtimes i think i am playing with hackers.. who wait for few seconds and gets the desired dice nunber....."
367,Sanyogita Pande,1,"Totally scripted and fixed game. Initially I had so much fun, but more games you play more you will get to know what's gonna happen next. Worst app. Makes you feel disappointed. People come here to have fun Ludoking, not to get discouraged. No random numbers at all. Everything is fixed from the beginning. I am uninstalling this."
368,Shakeel Jan vlogs,1,A nonsense app based on cheating and clearly favouring Indian users especially when you are winning from them in missions somehow one way or another you will lost the game in last.
369,hena parween,1,Very bad game gives 1 for 11 times regularly and very irritating This does not happen in real ludo they do it on purpose. And also the 7 up down is not luck they mostly take your money then giving
370,Ashutosh Nautiyal,1,This is a scripted game. The same person keeps on winning the game and also get the desired numbers which everytime turns the game in that person's favor.
371,Ankit Kumar,2,This game is good but when we are playing online i think it's fixed because almost all the times we don't get the number that we want and we lose the game and if we win any game then it's also because the opponent has not got the required number every time. It's totally a waste. You should play real ludo and not this ludo kinf.
372,Betrand Obad,2,The dicing isn't fair at all. The thrown does not give random values especially when playing online with friends.
373,vinfred jeremiah,1,"It always letting me to lose. Always the actual number falling for opposite member, but for me it is always actual digits are not coming. One the worst game I ever saw in my life, please learn from pubg. This is actually fixed, because when ever I got 3 coins inside but with that one coin I am loosing game. Y this happing. And more over equip like real ludo don't be like foolish games. Waste of spending time in ludo king"
374,Anwar Azad,4,"Do you have any near future plan for introducing voice chat with players,? We want voice chat option in this game."
375,shadab saifi,1,Whenever I'm trying to play online it's always showing me connecting to server I have already reinstalled it 2-3 times but still it doesn't working?
376,Laraib Kazi,3,The game is totally based on algorithms which is predictable in the beginning only. WHY THE HELL ALWAYS I AM LOOSING THE GAME.!!!!!
377,Abhinav Patel,1,"Frustrating!!! It's absolutely very bad game..... It decides first to whom the winner should be. It doesn't matter how well you played...If you are about to win and the opponent's all are left unopened, the game stops you at that point and the it allows the opponent to win first.....reallly very frustrating!!!!!!!"
378,harsh yadav,1,"Literally the most broken app on playstore today. If you feel like you are good at ludo then dont bother installing this app. The game is set the moment you enter a match so even if u've got the best luck and skill in the world you wont win. For example i needed 1 to win a game, rest struggling to get 2nd place given how far ahead i was. I rolled 19 times 19 and still didn't get that 1 and rest of them were like 6, 6, 5 boom in. Also if you wanna increase the chances pay them money and you win."
379,Sumit Patil,1,Worst experience. Crash every time when i try to play online.Inspite of updating app the problem is not solved.Uninstalling the app.
380,Prithviraj A,1,No improvement even after several feedbacks. 1. Too much program controlled rolls. Never get 6 More then twice? 2. The other player get a 6 when my piece reach out after crossing his house initial position. 3. Too hard to get through the initial level - a payment gimic to purchase more coins. 4. Really waste of time. Even offline game would finish faster than this. 5. Always bugs with connecting with friends 6. Network issues. Even for small fluctualtion in network. Uninstalling for ever
381,Adnan sheikh,1,"Its the worst ludo game ever created. I dont know why Google Play doesn't have a 0.1 star rating because this is what this game deserves. Every time i play this game i am like i am going to lose. For example - If i am 3 steps away from blue, there are 80% chances that blue will get 3. I can't stop saying that this is the worst ludo game. Just remove it from Google Play dude. I don't even like this game but there is no better alternative. I hope you get Coro*a for what game you have made."
382,R J,1,My game stopped in between without network problem. I again rejoined then too same problem. And finally I lost.
383,Manoj singh,1,I could have given even lower rating if possible. You can easily sense which way the game is gonna go from the start as it is designed in a way that it already decides which player is gonna win by itself and then you just have to go through the formality of playing. I have played a lot and only then am I saying this. It should be random not pre decided. What is left to do there other than roll the dice if the conclusion is crystal clear from the start.
384,Aryan Bhaseen,1,"The worst game in the world. There are no live gaming with opponents, it's just a trick to make you fool. Whenever you come close to your opponent, he gets six....not in one game but in many other games. They just pock opponents name and plays a trick with him and make him fool. At last, i suggest all of you to uninstall this game and buy a real ludo board from the market and play with your family and friends. Thankyou"
385,Sagar Raval,1,Totally Bias game you can easily identify winner player who got 5 to 6 and you get 1 or 2 only. Third quality app with 3rd category developers...
386,Payal Nagpal,1,There's no place to give minus rating..so i gave the least..it doesn't deserve to get even that...the most biased and fixed platform...you can never win against the one having highest coins ...even the chances that you get after flipping ..it won't stand anywhere against the highest coiners.. They will beat you in every way possible and the lowest coiners cant even touch even if you get 100 chances.. there's no point in playing if you have the lowest coins compared to your co- players.
387,Zakyyah Rossan,1,Its stuck and freezing! This was not an issue before. Now i cant even play.
388,PIKULAL BEHERA,1,Very annoying. You don't need skills. Very demotivating. It may let you believe that you are unlucky. I shouldn't have installed this.
389,Anuj Arora,1,Totally Scripted! Use some real algorithm of probability! I rated this game 5 stars before but after playing this for some more time i realised that it is scripted.
390,Krunal Jani,1,"I liked this game. But yes, as everyone said, this game break the rules of probability. When you are in outer circle, chances of you getting 1-2 is more than the 6. And once you enter the inner line and need just 1 or 2, suddenly chances of getting 6 are more than chances of getting 1-2. How? Now uninstalled this game. No respect to law of probability. They just want a person with least amount of coins win. They want to keep everyone even those without skill. It is pure luck, no skill needed."
391,Swati Suman,1,"I don't know why this happened but it happened twice. I wanted to play with my friend so he created a room and sent me the code on instagram when I opened this app to enter the code and join the room, without me entering the code it joined automatically to the same room. I don't know how is that possible except this app is Also stealing personal data of people. I'm uninstall the app due to same reason, I don't think this app is safe to use."
392,Angel Nadar,1,Worst Game. Disturbs your mind. I just had 1 coin out and needed one in dice to win the game. Stupid game. But I liked the graphics.
393,Harsh Patel,3,The game has bad algorithm. If a person at start get knocked he definitely would be knocked out of the game continuosly by players . And if the any other player doesn't get knocked after one complete round probability is the player would get least knocked and get favourable dice number and after some time same thing will happen again. This not any review out of hate . I have experienced it by a span of continuous play for over 2 weeks and 4 games every day.
394,divya verma,1,"App crashes a lot: while creating a room, mid-game as well. Very poor user experience"
395,Dhwanil Shah,1,Paid to remove ads. Can't use the app at all now. Keeps crashing.
396,zeus olumpus,1,"Extremely biased game, you cannot win against someone at higher level. Very stupid algorithm."
397,Social and political Activities,1,i face many problems for using this app like create a room. me and friends create room then i m face problem for joining . because show a error - app is mismatch.
398,Nidhi Bhartiya,1,"Really don't know what actually algorithm or calcolations you guys used in this game. Person is playing smartly but if they stuck just a one step before the winning,it won't be possible that person will win...yeah on the other hand the other person will complete the whole game and enter their all the coins and win that game...but the person who is waiting in the whole game is never be a winner"
399,Debasmita Dash,1,"The game is always under maintenance, it's full of ads, apart the dices are supposed to be random but they are not.The game will want you watch ads to make coins which they will eventually take away so that you end up watching more ads in order to play tournaments. Do not install this game. It is super frustrating not worth time"
400,Manish Dhanuka,1,"Game is fix, teriko bembari hoge corona virus. I have 83910 coin but my 2000 coins of level up was nt added it should be 85910. It's cheating ur robbing coins,Usless cheater , big cheater ,"
401,Kaizeen Daruwalla,1,Absolutely rubbish game! I won't even give it 1 star! The dice is not random at all! It will make you wait at the winning point till the opponent has brought in all their pieces and will still make you lose! It defies all the laws of probability! Waste of time! Entire thing is rigged!
402,Abu Bakar Siddique,1,They are lucky that there is no option for Zero star. Once i have started a game of 50000. It didn\u2019t find any opposition. Later on i find coins are gone. Game of Injustice . But it also has a serious drawback. Sometimes it gives undue benefits to someone. Sometimes it is seen that opponent is getting six continuously and also getting desired score to cut my one. And in a single game somebody has done it 11 times whereas i didn\u2019t get any opportunity. So it is a one sided game. Need a Balance.
403,The World Is My Kitchen,1,Game play itself isn't bad. It's just that the dice rolls aren't random. They're trying too hard for the game to finish closer than it should be. More than a 100 years old this simple game lasted that long test of time not because it was manipulated by creators. Uninstalling this first thing after lockdown ends. Also I have no problem with ads I understand creators need to make money but manipulating dice rolls is not cool.
404,Manisha Bajaj,1,Its feel like a scripted one.. Whenever i play with some online person.. Its giving 6 to opponent like anything.. Nd giving exact score everytime
405,Anita Mallik,4,"Wow! Very good game😊-themes unlock by coins There are 2PLAYERS,3P,4P,5P and 6P. Please on this feature-7P,8P,9P and 10P"
406,vijia lashmi,1,They themselves say best game in googleplay.worst game it is.no innovations or creations just copied ludo board game.yons of ads while starting any match.it is luck game.waste of storage and time.
407,Arafat,1,It is a completely fixed game there is no randomization in numbers. The app's developers have made a formula to play the game. If we don't play by that rule we'll lose no matter how good we play or how lucky we are in general. And the game will not end until all the four pawns of the four players go in their colors. It is ridiculous not worth the time. Over all it is a cheat and nothing like the real game.
408,Janvi Kotak,2,"At night time this app is hanged while game is on 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻 cant play properly sometimes , specily at night time after 7 pm app is not working properly ."
409,Animesh Kishore,1,"Over aggressive algorithms makes it annoying to play. The lockdown and utter boredom dragged me in. Within a couple of games I regretted it. The algorithms are over aggressive and stupid, designed to make the game fair. Whilst noble, it makes no sense to me when I've got the last 2 of my coins in the final home column with the other player having 3/4 of distance to go with 3 of his, and yet he wins, whilst I sit there like an idiot. I'd have more chance at a real board game 99/100 times Stupid."
410,Soumi M,1,It was good till last update. After updating latest update game will auto close and crashes. Revert back latest update
411,Uttam Kumar,1,Worst ever. The game should be removed from the play store. But i know thats not gonna happen.. This game sucks. Even if you are about to win the game in a just 1 roll by the opponent takes a whole round of the board and won.. and i didnt got 1 after rolling 16 times.Is this ever possible .. I would have got 1 ten times on real ludo board. Its totally fixed.. Those are not random numbers.. If it continues a majority of people will be uninstalling this game.
412,Devil no 4,1,"Bruh, u just can't say this game is based on luck from what I've experienced just a minute ago, everytime i go for the online mode.. it suddenly begins the ""rig this game mode"" like the opponent i was with was getting 6,6 on every roll, while i had to wait ten rolls to even get one 6. Game not rigged? Really? BRUH fix this or imma delete this app and if u guys think what's the worse that can happen by a puny one user leaving then, that also will show how much careless u guys are."
413,Kalp Tripathi,1,"Whenever I try to earn the coins by watching videos online or spinning the wheel then it always come retry after the 1st watch or spin...I mean that after the 1st watch or spin....When I try to watch another video it comes ""retry"" which is not justified at all!!.... secondly we can't even send emojis while typing whenever we are playing online with buddies.So pls improve that at the earliest and hope to get response from you soon.Otherwise many people like me will not refer this app to others!!"
414,techno blitz,1,"This game will torture you. They are hacked and other players can easily win. There is no shame in saying that you will loose the game just because others can control this game. They can easily get 6 on every dice role. Doesn't matter, how many times you report them but still game will allow them to play. Throw out your stupid developer. Instead of focusing on your advertisements, focus on developing a unbiased game."
415,silo editz,1,I cannot login it takes about 30 minutes to login and network is very slow while in app.
416,Nitin Kashyap,1,Dice roll is sometimes erratic and automatically rolls back. Irritates a lot when this happens.
417,Chintan Kansara,1,"Eg 1. Never won PLAY ONLINE. PLAY ONLINE user is played by the system itself to take away our coins. The opponent gets exact numbers to kill my piece when I m nearby. Infact opponent gets 6 once n twice to go far away to run or to get inside the house. ALL ALGORITHM Eg 2. My 4 pieces r in the base. I get 6 on the dice, I am out of my base. Next I get is 3. The next player kills me again n get me back in the base. What was the point system getting me 6 to come out. PLAY WITH FRIENDS OPTION IS \U0001f44d"
418,Vanisha Prakash,3,"Okay okay experience.. i just want you guys to solve one problem. Whenever we get a six we dont get to see which number we wills get after getting a six in next chance. Also when we kill somebody with that 6 we dont get another chance. Also , give us an option to use 6 and the other number together. U people should make it more realistic.\U0001f611\U0001f611 everything else is fine. I hope you understand."
419,Shalini sharma,1,"Like seriously!! U guys really really really need to be honest on the dices..How can we repeatedly get just ones and twos like 50 times.... lol and that too in every game I play. And how can the opponent get the exact number he wants everytime, I hv seen this in 40 odd games. This is the worst ludo game I have ever played. People please IAM giving an honest opinion please don't waste your time n space of your mobile and don't install this ludo game...It's a waste.. PLEASE!!"
420,Anita Kumari,1,"I wanted to give it zeri rating . Very bad game .In this what happens if your all tokens are inside, and you are just going to win then the number will never come on your dice . It happens with me every time. Last time, I needed to get only 2 to win but the no. did not come and in that time opponent wins even,if his tokens are very far from me ."
421,Antriksh Dhamani,1,Just hate this app\U0001f621\U0001f621.. They just randomly select one person who should win anyhow.. \U0001f624 I was just about to win and need only one in dice.. and the other player just started to run.. But he win and I lose.. \U0001f914 This is not just a coincidence and happen with me many times.. \U0001f620 The dice is not \u274c random at all.. One player gets six most of the time and other just one and two..
422,Prasad Jamnerkar,4,"I want to upload my original pic for DP, but dont want to login with facebook ..... u will provide this feature without logging to Facebook or google.... kindly fix this issue"
423,sudhakar N,1,Ghost gameplay experience . Fully connections error .network Maintenance error Run time error logout at every time.
424,SAHAJ GOYAL,1,The numbers appearing on the dice are totally biased and not randomised at all. You guys fix the matches in order to earn coins and sell them for money online. It is a fixed game. I my family members and friends all have the same opinion. We all are uninstalling the game and will recommend the same to all. We too will take action against you guys for befooling others.
425,Ankit Raj,1,"Algorithm of this game is very bad. Everytime when i was about to win, it's algorithm help the opponent and he/she wins. Ok if it happens sometimes but it happens regulary with me. Dice only show those numbers which makes the game interesting and the person who always win by his strategy in real ludo, always loses in this ludo king"
426,Prayesh Kandarkar,1,"Uninstalling after playing 2 months... I played intellectually & found the algorithm is biased.it always favours opponents so that you loose your points and then for more points u waste your precious time and money. It's a kind of addiction. For not to get loosing mentality, I am uninstalling this game.. if you want to enjoy the game don't install this game...if you want to enjoy looser mentality, this is for you..."
427,Subhranil Kolia,3,"A very complicated game. Actually, the game is overall cool, but the strategy of the computerised dice is not understandable. Whenever I want 6, it either gives 1 or any other number and vice versa. In the game, when I've come to know that I'm in the way to win, the dice makes the turn reverse and the losing guys might have won the game. And overall, the technique of this game is totally different than the real board game. So, none can judge the number that he/she might get in turn!!!"
428,Tabish Bukhari,1,I am totally happy with this game...and if you are earning money from some badass ads then the creator should think which ads should be allowed on this app... because it's not an simple app more now...this app is now using small child's and also family member.. suddenly a nonsense ads comes on screen..at that time you an idea how it feels when you are playing with your elder family member... think of it founder..
429,Ameen Patel,1,"It's very bad and unfair game at the last moment the game change direction towards opponents side ,not many time everytime i used to come near to win game and suddenly change will happen and opponent will win , I will give 0 rating to this game ,The game never satisfied me when i am playing online ,It's ok while playing online but in online the game used to take opponents side only ,the loosing of every game give me irration and angry . It's increase my stress. So this game is very bad to me okk"
430,jyoshna bodda,1,"It's entertainment but It's totally one side game to a player. The dice is so biased. After reaching certain level the chances of getting win is almost zero. Most of the time we need just 1or 2 to win the match, but the dice won't let us win even after the opponent has 1 more token to win. It's totally unfair and disappointed game. My review is based on the experience for last 50 days."
431,Nancy Tuli,1,"The dice is biased. You should not integrate your own logics to make the game interesting. Let us play just like we play ludo in real. Why you have to make every game interesting. It should be a fair game. I have played numerous times and found that the dice is biased. Everything else is good in it but predictable dive numbers make it worse. Due to that, lost interest in the game. Kindly make it a fair game !"
432,technical & digital guidance,1,"Very bad experience , because I have purchase 100000 coins & 125 gems. & I paid 120 Rs but coins & gems not add in my wallet & amount debited 2 time from my account"
433,A Google user,1,"This is the most fixed game I've ever played in my life. On a several occasions I've played, I was 100% due to win and only one counter left, while the other players have 4, they still manage to win! How absolutely ridiculous! I'm very angry with this game. Complete set up and all fixed! I wouldn't have even given it a one star. This is just a fixed game where most Indians win! Shame on you!"
434,Amarnath Ghorai,1,"What a wonderful game. If someone really wants to be frustrated , then this game is the perfect one.. Even they can throw their phone at a minimum speed of 60 km/hr. ----- Today I reached first . I was 1 step far for the victory.. but , every one was far away.. I didn't get the 1 and the game was ended.. i was in the 4th place.. now my opinion for this game,, ""bewafa ludo"". I was dreaming that , at least now I am going to win \U0001f622. But , the game don't like me."
435,Fajarul Agdas,1,The game is all good. But there is one main problem. The game looks fixed . Like it chooses a person randomly and gives him numbers according to his favours. It really destroys the fun of the game. It is as if I can tell who might win with first few turns. Please stop this mess. In all games there will be a person who gets lots of 6 and a person who gets very less 6.
436,S B PRODUCTS - WAMM,5,"Glorious game...... Its very exciting game for family members especially when they all spend their time in playing together and let to laughs, suspense, and joy.... In previous days their was a ludo board and tokens in which we have to arrange them and move the tokens forward but this game saves that time and we can easily get joy in the mobile itself we just have to touch on screen...... The graphics are awesome and the is the game which have a special space in everyone's phone.Its glorious."
437,chandan kumar yadav,1,If you think the outcomes of the dice in this game are random then please do come out of your hallucinations. There can never be any code that can deliver random outcomes. You need to apply certain conditions in order to get the output. If you play the game for several days you can almost ascertain the times when you are going to get a roll of 6 on the Dice. Similarly the win & loose too depends on the pre-match profile validation within the game. So the gist of the matter is that its fixed.
438,roshni lakshman,1,It's rigged. I can literally guess the next number. You can figure out who's going to win from the beginning of the game. I'm assuming If make in app purchases you will win consistently. I use to love the game in the beginning now its just frustrating. I'm deleting the app. It's seriously not a fun game anymore. It has amazing graphics but till they fix their algorithm I won't nothing to do with it.
439,Gautam Padhariya,5,"Hi, I cant login with my fb I'd, actually I can but I cant see my balance,(it is 00), n even i cant start game, message is blinking connecting to server Pls help me or try to fix it"
440,Sreejith V S,1,"I hate this game. Absolute fake game. The opponent coins always gets the number to kill you and opponent are almost going to win then you will get 6,5,4, continuously which is no use at that time. In case if you recover the game you and opponent have same number to win the game that time also you will get continuously 6,5,4 number and you need 1or2. Finally opponent win the game....."
441,Karan Valecha,1,"One of the most biased games ever played. It has a pre decided winner, who always gets the right numbers needed for the victory whereas even when the other player tries to play safe, certainly even a move from the safe spot will kill him. It is worst to play this game even for time pass as it will swing your good mood to angry. Doesn't even deserve one star. I deleted this game and those who want to install, I would strongly recommend please DON'T."
442,gaming in hindi,1,"Hate it. It is unfair game the one who goes first in the end row only wins and it gives more 6 to only one player that can be anyone the numbers are not random the follow a sequence and wants to make you win in starting but then they want you to lose so that you get angry against the another online person and you wish to play one more chance. At the end I wanna say that please make your own ludo on a paper it is not difficult, it will just take about 2 minutes justl like maggi and can also make a dice with bedrock"
443,surender singh,1,"Terrible experience from last 10 days, While playing game it is showing disconnected even though my wifi & mobile data is on & it is not 1 time it's been from last 10 days. Is it some Hack by players ? You need to resolve this issue on priory. I have a paid version of this app if I am facing such issues god's knows what about the rest ?"
444,HARI KRISHNAN,4,Your game was awesome please add voice chat on friend multiplayer ..and also add team matches in online especially in room match we believed that you add this features in upcoming upadtions....
445,Parvaz Ghori,1,"Worst game I have ever played, before it was so fun to play but after I lose all coins, I started to watch videos to earn coins, but after that I rarely win any game because the algorithm or the back end of the game doesn't wants me to win, coins as they know that repeatedly watching the videos that's why the game always make me lose. Because by watching videos they will get more clients to earn money by video advertising so it was really very bad experience for me. It was worst."
446,Sahana Pandian,1,"Algorithm for the die is not random. Kind of predictable. If any player starts and crosses the other player's region, the other player immediately or soon will get a 6. The last finishing point is totally predictable. With two players left, if the other person struggles to come to the finishing point while the other player needs a one, the moment the struggling player almost touches the finishing line, the other player always wins. Worst algorithm."
447,Subhashree Pattnaik,1,Nonsense App.opponent had 4 dots in the box and i needed only 1 to win but till the end I couldn't finally she won.how it is possible.i could not get 1 in 50 dice roll.Disgusting app i just uninstalled it.and pls don't install the game...very disappointed
448,Paras Bansal,1,Something has changed drastically in this game as it's no more a game but a kind of mental harassment. Either it's one sided win or one sided defeat. Please check else people won't enjoy this game anymore and will be uninstalling as quickly as it was installed. I agree there's no benefit to you if dice is biased. Technically I think there is only one is random number generator used in this while there should be as much as number of players so that it's independent random number for each player.
449,EM Mckenzie,2,"After playing for some time now I agree that the algorithms are faulty and for that reason I have dropped it from four to two stars. What are the odds of me killing all my opponents pieces and all my four pieces get to the home stretch and my opponent still wins? Or better yet I have full bars but the game says no network connection when it's time for me to roll the dice reconnect when it's my opponents turn forcing me to forfeit. Hopefully I can find a better app, because I love this game!"
450,Percival Domingo,1,A year later and still the Worst game ever... very partial... I have only 1 token left and still the opponent is winning where he still has 3 left...
451,Ritesh Punmiya,1,Very bad game ever and a very big cheating as i needed 1 for my home and my friends 1 pieces had not came out but still they won. I dont know how it got 4.3 stars it should get less than 1.Then again I played a game and I needed 1 for my home but the other one who was half the way far got many sixes and he won that game. The opponent always gets sixes and I get only 1 or 2. I have won from 10 game.Whatever the opponent needs he gets that. Never play this game. Its not Ludo King. It is dummy Ludo
452,shubham dubey,1,"Wow, looks pretty good from the outset but it's terrible, I have been a good player of this game always buy guess what, on ludo king I have 5 wins and 25 losses. That's something funny unless the game is designed in a manner in which certain users are bound to lose and certain bound to win despite their gaming abilities. Such a pity!"
453,Mohit Kumar,3,"The game is good and all. The interface is also good. But the game sucks in its predictive dice value. It's not at all random. It occurs seeing the dice value of other players and tends to match it likewise. For eg. if I get a six, my opponent is bound to get a six in the next two turns. This is where this game becomes disastrous. The dice values are supposed to be random, not based on some algorithm."
454,Charumathy R,1,"I'm not able to play with friends while clicking that option it keeps on showing connecting to server even I have good internet connection and it takes more time to create or join the room. And most of the time, when we are playing with friends the game is getting stuck so I'm not able to continue but still others can play with it and after that automatically the game has been ended up so I lost the game. Sometimes, the same problem faced by my friends also.."
455,HARSH SAINI,1,"Worst gameplay, game is designed to take more and more time to play. The dice is not fair, it works a way if a player is winning it automatically goes against him and you'll get beated. Seeing this you'll get irritated. Not a fair game at all and also consumes so much battery power. I wish there was an option of giving negative rating, surely I would choose the lowest."
456,Vamshi Dhar,1,"It's just fc**king game....my opposite players are wining always(my level in game is 72level), One or two times it's Ok. it's happening daily, at the end of the game. My opposite player coin at starting point and my coins are at home and ready to win.. My opposite player will come to home and last he/she win... The worst app\U0001f621"
457,shivraj singh negi,3,This app seems to have one objective: Keep people involved as long as possible. Games get drawn out unnecessarily for long as someone gets a throw to cut someone's token. I counted the number of throws over multiple games and it seems to chose one particular player for getting higher number throws. Statistically you expect that in a game of 100+ throws....long term avg for everyone to be 3.5 and throws will be equally distributed between 1-6 (16% of each). But it doesn't happen!
458,manikantakumar rongali,2,"First I love this game to play everytime. Now also playing but the worst thing is, after I won the game not giving exact coins how much I won, showing less coins . Ex: if I won 9500 coins it's provided only 5000 Or less then that. And too that lucky roll also showing wrong things. This is the worst experience with this app now"
459,hiyu hiya,1,"Worst gaming experience till date. Always show ""under maintainance"" message. Don't know why you guys developed the application without tested it properly. Found lots of issues as gone though the app. Need to focus functionality and load testing. Also, please work on your 'Play with friends' module."
460,Parth Asher,1,"The 'random' algorithm is highly predictable after a few games. The 4 player set up is designed to vandalise the player. You almost know that the token behind yours will take you out, 70% of the time. Needs improvement. The online section isn't a treat either. The algorithm is set to roll small numbers so the opponent can screw you left right and centre. How is it that I won 50 games with the computer but no luck online? Looking elsewhere. - 1"
461,Bareena Begam,1,"Super biased, flawed algorithms. 1.You get a 6 when your opponent token is nearby 2. When you make one wrong move, you are done for the game. Sometimes you wouldn't even know what to move. 3. You have gone all the way near to home suddenly a opponent gets 6 & 6 &4 to kill you. You see this as a randomness?This is just one occasion there are many to list. 4. You win 3 games staright, then are bound to lose the next one or two, no matter how strategically you play. 5. Favours fun over fairness."
462,Jing Pong,2,The game is good.. But the two things need to look here are : 1) Why does it require good Internet connection to play online? While the other online games which have higher gb in the game does not require that much strong internet connection as required in this ludo King. 2) The dice. Like C'mon it's so predictable. I sometimes feels like the system itself supports a particular player. So please look into this matters at the earliest.
463,BMK,1,"The game is not at all randomised, it has an algorithm where it makes the game come to an end where all are near the same level, so that there are more neck and neck finishes, which makes the game very unfair. What's more, the game seems to target one person every game, which makes the game extremely bad for them, whereas the others have a fun game at the expense of them. This gameplay mechanic sucks too. Would give 0 stars if possible."
464,Amita Rai,1,"Stupid. Why do you make the dice fixed on killing a player??? I was cut thrice without making it halfway as your. Stupid. Game makes the dice focus on me and me only. Not recommended if you want a fair game. Do not play. It. Sucks. Recently, I had my sister trapped but nothing happened. Only she could eat me and run by getting a six after knocking my pawn(?) out. Stupid and useless creators. Please do not play."
465,Akanchha Anjani,1,"Today I had a very bad experience !! Everytime inspite of having so fast internet connection, it showed no internet and ends the game letting the opponent win my entire coins !!! I lost so much of coins today !! Its really frustrating !!! Please try to resolve this issue. I checked out in Google what might be the reason for this and it suggested to get the latest version installed !! M using latest version only still facing such issue !! This is disgusting !!!"
466,Mazahir Kassim,1,"The game is very baised it is aware off the positions off the players and it already plans out who will win people wait for a number for 10minutes while the other player gets it in less then 5 seconds it annoys everyone and it doesent give u a opotunity to win the game has favourites and its not everyone! When u first download it, it gives u chances to win because your a starter as u get used to the game it wont be as easy as it is! I rate this a 1/5.My own opinion."
467,Niranjan Chakankar,4,It's a great game..one suggestion could you please add feature to talk between players..so it will be more fun and excitement
468,Bhanu Thakur,1,Worst game I have ever played. Please don't waste your time here. All games have fixed algorithm. If they want to win your opponent he will win it doesn't mean how smarter you played the game.... 🖕🖕👎👎👎👎👎👎I am going to uninstall this. Good bye
469,AJAY SADHASIVAN K,1,Very bad experience They have already decided in the beginning who will win the game. Worst experience I had. If you want only a particular player to win then don't ask others to play as well. The game is completely biased.the player with more XP or level will win for sure. If you cross them even by a six and a five they will cut you in the very next move. But for the lower leveled not. Extremely disappointed.
470,Himansh Mishra,1,"The algorithm used is very very predictable. I am 200% sure there is no random number in place here. UI and all are good...just that game is very predictable. Not only me my whole family when we played during Corona lockdown were able to predict some of the moves quite accurately. The person wining will be lowered time to time to bring back action. I also think there is some time constraint involved here, for instance even if a player reaches closed to home spot he/she will not get the number"
471,Yash M,1,"This game sucks. It totally kills the rule of probability on which dice rolling works. They claim that numbers are random which are not really. I am putting few instances as example. 1. You will not get first 6 unless and until your opponent's token reaches the star. 2. Your opponent will get exact number to kill ypur token 3. The game will prioritize one person from the beginning, sometimes it may be you also. 4. Your fourth token will get stuck and you will not get a 1 even in 15-20 rolls"
472,pabitra 1234,1,"Can u believe that sometimes the opposite party scores only 6,5,4.. And the whole game i use to score 1,2,3 and sometimes 6"
473,namirah golandaz,1,Horrible application of the concept of probability. This game is so flawed. There is always a person who gets a lot of 6 and one who gets very less. They randomly select someone and alot numbers in their favour. When we played the real one in childhood no such thing used to happen. Whenever I play online I have noticed if I have won a previous match I won't win it the next time and it's for sure.
474,Roop ShankarMazumder,1,Now the site under maintenance issue is mostly resolved but after playing considerable amount of games I have come to the conclusion that this game is totally biased. Your opponent will get the exact value every time to knock you off. Initially I was of the opinion that maybe its my bad luck but then i realised that it is being done on purpose. This game would irritate you to the core and i would suggest opting for some other games instead. Almost all the reviewers are of the same opinion.
475,kannan venkit,1,System decides who has to win at the beginning of the game. The system is not generating the number randomly. It decides who has to win and the number genrates accordingly. I have played n number of times and same happened many times. I'll uninstall the game soon if this isn't fixed. I wonder if the issue was onmy for me. After going through review most of them are feeling same and it proves the dice rolling is not not at all random. Very very poor way of programming. Simply pathetic.
476,Mohammed Marzooque,1,"The interface is good and catchy but the algorithms are messed up and it's not a fair game. The game should be open for all, here either it all goes in your favor or you're done before the game starts. One of the biggest flaws is when you get 6 on dice you have to decide first before rolling the next dice. It would have been better if we're allowed to roll the 2nd dice and then decide altogether. Go for Ludostar if you want a fair match."
477,Ajinkya Ambatwar,1,"With new update, not able to connect to server. It says Connecting to Server and then nothing happens. Also speaking of Gameplay, the dice roll is not Unbiased Uniform distribution which it should be instead it is rigged by so many ""if...else"" conditions... really unfortunate \U0001f614... Update: Even with the new update, the issue is not resolved. So much of irresponsibility from the devs. Not even replying to my feedback..!!"
478,Prasenjit Mitra,1,There are many hackers. Even if you play with your full intelligence and luck you can't win. Luck and hacking can be understood .We are not donkeys. We have sixth sense. Please see to this matter. I am very disappointed. By the offline mode is good but online popular mode is horrible and full with hackers. Please look into this matter. Okk. Please
479,Jinesh Parekh,1,"If there is negative rating I would given -5, I thought its random dice number they say, randomness of the dice is so predictable that my last tile piece will loss against 3 opponent as even after 20 turns I can't get one on my dice which only thing I need to win, and I thought thats only one time deal but after so many games it seems it can't be that random. Hope they clear the randomness issue, enjoyed playing first few game but it's irritating now."
480,Diggvijay Naruka,1,"In this game a lot of problems because this game runs on maintenance most of the time. Suggestion 1. At that time we are not able to play properly, whenever it is in it, we cannot accept buddy request nor They are able to send request. 2. It does not have any maintenance message in the alternate message section. If there is any maintenance in the game, then there should be an alternative message option in it. If we received a request, we can tell that the game is currently on maintenance."
481,srajan jain,1,"The app is totally worthless. The algorithm written is totally abysmal and clearly don't work on the principal that probability of all the faces coming are equal. It clearly works in opposite direction. At the start of game when u need 6, it will hardly come and in the end when you need 1 or 2, the number of 6 will flourish. I am utterly disappointed with the app. Also, for most part of the the app us under maintenance. A complete abysmal app in short."
482,Sujoy Ghosh,1,"Fully controlled by the computer/app.... Every game at the last it's always about 1 Point I can understand a couple of times but not always. It makes you play big by giving you missions and then all of a sudden your opponent scores exactly to get you out, again that cannot be a coincidence. And if you start buying coins you are gone it will force you to buy more coins. Pathetic."
483,Mithlesh Chandra,1,"No! There is not any random dice all dice are fixed. I don't know who is reading this message dont play this game its frustrating. I'm keep losing and losing again. If you are thinking to purchase some gemes then you're an idiot all your gemes are useless this game is only for frustrators, f***ing sh**t.!!!!!!!"
484,Priyanka L,1,"Something's wrong with the algorithm, plz change it, always the opponents get 6 in our place and we always get caught by the opponent. I reviewed the game with 5 stars a week ago but am fed up of always loosing in the game\U0001f612 I try to escape but the opponent gets exact no to always catch me \U0001f644 how is this possible everytime???"
485,rahul sinha,1,This game first allows you to win and when you win some levels then all of sudden it turns to a cheat game. The dice never rolls to favourable and there is a loose match almost everytime. What algorithm they use but doesn't seem to be much interesting now to keep it. Will uninstall it soon. There is something wrong with this game and that's for sure!!
486,priyabrat sahoo,1,"Yes they have used the random algorithm for the dice but the random algorithm doesn't work in a way we think, sometimes it shows baised results. But there are some particular cases that always happens. The next dice number is often predictable. If you think you gonna be killed it will definitely happen 99% of time. They must design this in a way that it should give distributed results. This is a good app but there are lot other ludo apps just try them. This one is the worst one."
487,Lucky,3,"This game is no doubt the best design among all other Ludos out there. But there is one serious flaw. In pass and play mode, the dice rolls are not random. For example, if player 1's coin is 3 places away from player 2, then the game ensures player 2 gets 3 on dice roll. If player 2 decides not to take out player 1's coin this time, the next roll will again give player 2 whatever number that's needed to take out player 1's coin ahead of him/her. It's like, the outcome is pre-decided."
488,Karan Nichani,1,"The worst game I have ever played in my life. Quite frustrating. I am not petty, honestly. It's the first time I'll be doing such a thing. But I gave 4 bad reviews from all the phones that are there in my house and am currently looking for my spare. I urge all of you to do the same, it will feel good. It is my earnest request to Google to ban this app. It is a scam that plays with the feelings of people."
489,Gopika PS,1,very much dissatisfied... only the opponent wins even if we have the chances to win..... Worst app... Waste of time.. They already fix who has to win...so it is not possible to win....even if we have chances to win... I at all interested to give any ratings.. they don't even fix these issues..try to fix this... Please . I played more than ten times even once I didn't win..even if I had a lot of chances to win.In this we win based on counts.. App already fixes who has win..................
490,Sharath Reddy,1,Worst game algorithm ever. Always 1 player out of 4 is biased and wins the game no matter what. Predicted game play
491,sahil supekar,1,"The algorithm behind the random dice number is so biased.Like i can sometimes literally guess what a person is going to get.Whenever you have the last piece near the house and you need 1 to win, you won't get it, Your opponent will get 6's and 5's so that he can reach quickly.Although you will win if your opponent has 2 or 3 pieces left, they will make you wait for almost 5 minutes Play with computer option is useless as if they are programmed to let us win.The game chooses a winner at Start"
492,Aman Sagar,1,"Wrost ludo game, it doesn't diserves a single star but Play Store have minimum 1 star so in compulsion I have to give it 1 star. I had played more than 50 times but i had got 1st position only one time, it was like a dream for proove i have taken a screenshot & send it to all my friends just for the shake of happiness... Please stay away from it, Pehli fursat me nikal \U0001f605"
493,arupjyoti borah,5,This game is awesome. Very good game to play with friends and family.I gave it 5 stars because it is an entertainment game and I like entertainment games
494,Nihar Kadam,1,"There is some serious issue with the randomisation of the dice. Whether it is during multiplayer mode or the side game called 7 up or down. The game is meant to make you lose no matter how you play. Edit: After submitting the review i played the game for like 5 times. None of the time had i got any fair chance to play. In one particular game, i wasn't even able to start my game while the opponent finished.by far the worst game I have ever played"
495,Pavneet Singh,1,"The dice is not at all random. Every time I come i front of a player, it gives him/her the same number. Happens continuously, multiple times. Also, while you are out of the home corridor, you will continuously get 1 many times. But when you are just standing there to enter middle box, you would keep on getting 6 5.. and so on... until the other person reaches and just wins. Its a fine game but the so pre planned dice rolls are a game spoiler. Its quite predicatable."
496,Prakash,1,"This is a programmed game. Patterns of numbers are easily visible. 1. When you approach to opponents area, they will get 6 easily. Same thing happens with your opponent. 2.You would never get three 6 in one go. 3. They have killed the joy ludo by removing the randomized numbers. It seems the game depends on how much gold coins you have and how much you are beting for. If you are putting last bunch of coins, you would surely win. In a nutshell, they've f*** the luck. Hence no fun. GoodBye..."
497,Swapna Roy,1,"Very bad game. Every time I play the game my opponent wins. First when I started to play this game I thought it was my bad luck, but day by day as I started using this app I found out that some sort of partiality is surely there. I am really depressed after playing it. I am going to uninstall this app, and even tell the other users to do so. Biased app."
498,Abhi Patidar,1,"For a game that is based on luck, they sure have pulled a number with this one. If you don\u2019t believe me, just see for yourself- for every game you play, the last 2, sometimes 3, tokens always end up neck to neck. If one of them is way ahead, they start getting smaller or unplayable numbers on the draw so that the ones lagging can catch up and the game is levels or becomes more \u201cexciting\u201d, so to say. The algorithm is so designed that the people winning or pulling ahead start getting"
499,Jenifer Johnson,1,The game is so biased! Its like the winner is already decided and the dice rolls according to that. Its not even surprising anymore. Not even exciting. And in the end the dice will bring the opponents in the same position to make it exciting but it only pisses the person off. Its become very predictable and biased!
500,Aditya Baruri,1,"The game is so great that bugs love this game. Even Shakuni would have lost here because the dice shows up numbers with such great inconsistency. Whenever your coins are about to finish, you will get only 6 or bigger numbers till the time your opponent reaches at the end. The game currently shows 17 consecutive wins. The thing is it just add up the wins even if it is not consecutive. Next thing is the tokens taken and captured. The values shown are interchanged outside and inside the match."
501,Arshiya Sultana,1,"I feel like this is scripted. And also, I have a strong Wi-Fi connection, I sit near the router to play this game but it says that I have no internet and asks me to quit the game. Why should I? I have invested coins in order to enter it and it simply asks me to quit and adds a loss into my profile. And the opponent gets the exact number, by which he/she can kill my token. Don't tell me this is based on my luck while your algorithm is the WORST."
502,Noopur mittal,1,App crashes after 15secs!! Cannot play a game. This is frequent after recent app update.
503,Radha. B. Mani,1,The game is highly biased. Need zero stars. There is a certain algorithm that ensures you don't get the required number while the opponent easily does.I just needed a die to complete the last coin whereas the other players completed two coins starting from first. Cheap behaviour of game. Even when I manually play I am more than good to play. Lots to improve or this game is not worth the hype. Uninstalling the game
504,Fuzail Khan,1,"A very bad biased game. I hate the games algorithm! It always favours the player with more pieces outside the Home and me who has played well and just needs a ""one"" on the dice to win the game will never get it till the other player catches up to me and he wins the game instead! It's really frustrating"
505,kumar shanu,1,"As you all know that Ludo is a strategy board game, but I can't see any strategy from any player except the computer itself. If this is the scenario what I am experiencing from the last 1 year better save our time at the start of the game itself so that we can do some important task and and concentrate on other games too. Truly pathetic game till date, worst experience ever . Finally thanks to the Inventor of this game who did not introduced a number less than 1."
506,Vijay Mathur,1,"Hi Team, I hope you all are doing well. I just wanted to highlight how silly the logic is. Game shows me that I am playing with a real user, but I can clearly see that I am playing with a bot and I loose how much so ever I'm trying. I am referring this experience when I tried to play premium for 9500 match. This is so disgusting that such a popular game is playing cheap thrills. Grow up. Games should be fair, we don't olay to waste time. Also, 7 up and down is same. #CHEATERS #PLAYFAIR"
507,Aditya Verma,1,"Developers say that the dice numbers on every chance are randomly generated. I refuse to believe this. Dice numbers are scripted and fixed. If not, then, 1- Why three sixes are never generated in a row? 2- Why two or more tokens of a player don't occupy same cell except the safe cells in the game? Hence, fixing is proved. The game could have become more interesting and natural if the numbers were actually generated randomly."
508,Deepika Shakya,1,"I thought it was amazing game but i noticed that all the time. when I just need 1 or 2 to win it will not come till the opposite mate came to winning point and also they win, most of the time I lose or get 3rd position. Plz it's a humble request to make this game as similar of ludo. If anyone wants to decrease the level of confidence they can download it. I don't even know why the hell I am giving to 1 star this game don't even deserve that. Disgusting game."
509,Dastagir Shaikh,1,"I enjoyed playing this game before but now it's like the opponents get the exact numbers which they want, every body is at the end of the game and I'm still inside and when it gets out one of the opponent cuts me out of the game and it's been constantly happening for days and I've played almost 10+ games in which I've been cut off whenever I'm out or either i'm still waiting for 6!!! Very bad fix it! Didn't enjoy myself it pissed me off!!!"
510,Shiva Thakur,1,Really bad game. It all depends where you are located and how many coins you have. If you are in a first world nation then you are bound to have better luck against Asian players. If you have more coins than your opponent then their luck charm. There are better versions of ludo available on the playstore. If you are looking to have a fair game then avoid downloading ludo king.
511,Viki M,1,"Worst setup ever. Everytime the computer brings the opponent into the safe zone just to make the game gripping. The player waiting in the safe zone is Fxxxxd up unless ""One"" in rolled which doesn't roll. The algorithm is so messed up on purpose. The player who is supposed to lose, wins even if he is out of the safe zone & the player in the safe zone waiting for 'one' bloody loses. The Game needs improvement to stay true to its original gameplay. Il ask all my friends to uninstall the game asap."
512,shashi kiran verma,1,"I hate this game. It's all scripted and just useless. Instead if you've free time devote it to some good brain games. It's worthless and even if you're in good mood it can perfectly ruin it in minutes. It's utterly fake. But then to if you're interested you can try out manual ludo, it would it way more better than this stupid scripted game! I strongly dislike it! I wish I could give it negative ratings. You deserve that suckers!"
513,Ameya Deshpande,2,"Dice is rigged. Very frustrating. It works on patterns so as to make games close finishes. This can be ok for regular games, but don't ever try to complete any of 'missions' to unlock new themes. The 'popular' mode is a scam. It will end up wasting your time feeling frustrated. I played 15 games today to complete missions with opponents having half my level or one tenth my coins. I am fairly experienced with planning the moves smartly too. Yet because of the biased dice I lost 13 of them!"
514,saikirthanaa s,1,The game is very much scripted they are using the strategy of losing where it leads us to play another and so on...it's addictive and such a waste of time playing it the moment you get into a room you know who is going to win.....very much disappointed with this....and the users are not fool to use it and it won't last for long.
515,Radhanshi Ramraika,1,"Most biased game ever. The game is in favour of one person from the starting itself. That one person gets all the good numbers on the dice and the other person loses the game with worst numbers, no matter how good you play or strategise the other person will win the game. Even the dice rolls to number 6 all the time for one player and very few times for other. U need to work on the game so that it doesn't seem so biased."
516,adithya kanukanti,1,Is it just me or anyone else have seen this happened? All my tokens were in the house and the opposition a girl had none in the house and still I lost. How ridiculous is that? I have often seen that this game favours girls? Maybe I am sounding odd but I have seen it too many times to un-see it.
517,Shipra Gupta,5,Itz best game but it should add one feature in play with friends that is team playing and also 6 players can play in play with friends
518,Tsedon Dorji,2,Game connection times out and I lost my turn 3 times and lost a game I was otherwise winning. Not happy.
519,Ankit Soni,5,Best app ever enjoyable to everyone and every age of groups. Best connecting app also which helps us to feel ourself near to our relatives.
520,Saksham Kaktwan,1,Still have some connection issues they didn't fix it as they're saying that they did
521,Sandeep Singh,1,"Worst game ever, its created in a such way that only those people get most chance to win who played this game most of the time, other players who play rarely they lost most of the time, game algrothim setup is not interesting, dice roll is not random its programmed in a such way that you don't win easily. I don't recommned this game to anyone. Instead you can play hago or ludo club, ludo talent and other games."
522,Rhe Ga Shi,1,"I had 4,500 coins so I tried the '7 up down' feature and I won the bet and should have gotten 1000 but instead 300 was deducted from my coins making it a count of 4,200 which is just insane bc like I would get it if you say ""you 1000 if you bet 500"" and then instead of giving 500 +1000 you give back 500 + 500 but this app legit stole may coins away from me leaving me with 300 less than what I started with even tho I won two consecutive times. this makes no sense. would give 0 if possible."
523,DEVV GOSWAMI,1,This is a fraud game.. My three coins reached to the centre but only one coin left because the opponent was getting the exact number for sending it back to home again and again. Finally all the coins of the opponent reached to the centre and my one coins left. In 95% game i was totally in the position of winning and suddenly all reversed..
524,Abinash Brahma,1,"the most useless app. the probability of dice numbers is uselss, most playing with lady players. the cheapest game...... full of cheating"
525,Sundeep Amarnath,3,Why is my phone heating up? My phone gets hot when I play and my battery drains a lot. This is not a game that needs lot of processing or graphics like a car race or a first person shooter game. Something is fishy. Are the phones resources used for something else in the background? I also noticed my battery draining when I opened the app but not started a game yet. Waiting for your reply.
526,Kaushal Ravi Kumar,2,"This game is just sooo rigged. You may say the number on the dice is random but it just is not. Even a toddler could make out the difference. The people always just get the perfect number that they desire. It's not once, twice, thrice or 4 times, it's just always. Trust me, this is tooo good to be a random throw. I'm not accusing you of deliberately programming the game as such. At first, I loved the game a lot, but Ive played over a 100 games now and not 1 game have I won."
527,Sandi S,2,This game would be SO much better if the dice roll was actually random. As others have mentioned there is clearly a set algorithm and you can more or less tell at the start of the game if you're going to win or not. I've also noticed some players seem to somehow get double rolls without rolling a 6 or getting a pawn home...what's that about?
528,Gourab Mukherjee,1,"Rigged algorithms! I think they favour those who make a purchase in the game and remove ads. And for those who don't, they rig the game and never let them win. In this way we will lose all coins and eventually have to buy coins in the game. That is their strategy. Well i am not gonna spend money buying ur stupid coins...so bye bye... Uninstalled!!"
529,Ravinder Singh,5,I am not able to use diamond. Kindly suggest. Normally It's very good game. Specially in lockdown time. You can play with your friends and online also...
530,Carlie Gordon,1,"At first I really enjoyed playing it but then I realised that no matter how well you do, the game is rigged. If you are winning, you will get a few ones and twos which will ultimately make the other team players send you back. I know that's the name of the game but it happens when you are in front. The other players constantly roll 5&6's and you roll ones. The game is rigged. I wouldn't even bother playing it."
531,Jay N,1,"Totally biased game. Feels like the winner is fixed even before the game starts. How well you play, sometimes you find all 4 coins back in box. It's not about strategy, but developers facilitated cutting others coins to make the game more interesting, which I personally feel, is against the moral values. I have seen players quitting the game when their coin gets cut frequently. Smileys and comments from a unknown player is also disturbing. I played this almost a month! N this is not a fun game!"
532,Ankita Das,1,The dice is purely biased. I don't get the numbers I want to capture my opponent's token. And in fact i am the one whose tokens get captured each and every time. Its been 10 games and this still continues. The dice is not randomised at all. If your 3 tokens get into the house and u just need 1 to win the game then stop thinking abt winning the game in that case because that doesn't happen. I have to always face this thing. I am seriously disappointed.
533,Carin-lee Hendricks,1,"App is always under maintenance, or it just goes out of the app itself. Was a nice game. But ever since it been saying under maintenance,it's been a problem. Had to delete and download about 5 times already! The game is freezing! While playing. It has seriously list it's plot! While playing it becomes delayed! It's suppose to be better after maintenance but it is much worst now!"
534,Anil Kumar,1,"Worst way to enforcing update, it's not allowing to play without installing update.. Very worst part is, New update is not getting installed, giving me an error.. That means I can't play this game any more.. Kindly check with you developer to fix this bug and remove force update pop, and allow people to play endlessly without this weird restriction"
535,L X Ander,1,"I am being generous. The RNG of game isn't random. How hard is it to do that? The server is trash. Ads are poured like rain on my phone. The connection to server is trash. They won't fix any problem. Only the microtransactions are flawless. All the 5 star rating are from proud people who haven't played the game for more than 3 days. The game starts to give large number to the loser of the game in the intention to be a ""fair"" game. All the 5 star rating is to get the attention of blind developer"
536,Anamika Balouria,1,It's very annoying when the network connection error appears when you are almost on the verge of winning. Experienced it not only once but many times while playing. At first I thought it would be very genuine reason of network but even when there is not any network connection error it shows you have not been able to continue due to network issue. It stops us from playing during mission. It's not only experienced by me at an individual level but as well by my other family members & friends too.
537,Geetika raj,1,Worst app.... Disgusting game\U0001f621 The dice roll are not consistent some players always get more sixes then other players....If you need no.s 1 or 2 to win the game you keep getting 5 or 6 to wait for the other opponent to get near or win sometimes..\U0001f621......The machine sets the winner in the online version .Very convenient nd freaking nonsense!\U0001f621 It's just a big headache ...this problem should be fix soon ....
538,Mahima Singh,1,"Worst Game Ever! This game is so biased and I've given it a fair chance. You always lose even when your opponents still have 3 posts left and you're there waiting for that 1 to come so that you can win, but does it ever happen? NO! How can you not get 1 on the dice? Where on the other hand your opponents are rolling out all sorts of numbers with 3 posts left? LIKE WHAT??"
539,\u0995\u09a5\u09be \u0993 \u0995\u09be\u09b9\u09bf\u09a8\u09c0,1,"Worst ludo game ever! There is no network issues at all. Suddenly the game freezes in between and stupid auto moves are done. Initially I was winning it with strategy and luck... But as you are gradually addicted to it, you will start losing the game, you will have no idea why. It's their tactics to intentionally make you lose the game, so that you become more aggressive to win the next match and thus they earn. Too many ads, 7up down part is the most irritating one. You will keep losing always"
540,Hitlar G,1,Worst. The dice roll must be random. The stupidest person who ever developed it. Don't know even that dice rolls randomly and not by the position .
541,Sushma Uthaman,1,"It's very worst, I know all things are controlled by the computer but sometimes it doesn't even give a chance for others to win . Its making us to lose the game and play again and again. Very worst strategy guys. Everyone will continue playing only if they win at some point. Just change your machine control orelse your app will become serious lose in future."
542,Himaansho,1,"After playing 100 games I'm sure it deserves negative rating. Biased. Rigged like hell. Predecided winner. Favors new players to get high ratings on Play Store. Frustrating. Algorithm sucks. Only pretends to be random. Too many bots, hackers and ads. Favors paid players. Defies all probabilty theories. Lost 11 games successively. Dice seems random upto 15-20 games, after that no randomness at all. No strategy is useful when winner is already decided at start. That 7 game is designed to loot you."
543,Sudarshan Raju,1,"Very worst game. The game is always biased. When the opponent is closer, the number on dice will not be to our favour but when we are closer to the opponent, the number on dice will be favour to the opponent. Please make sure that the game is unbiased. It's really frustrating. Easily we are able to guess who is going to win. Uninstalled!!!!!!"
544,Darren Dsouza,1,"Horrible game... Can't get the 1 or 2 nowadays to go home The other person needing 2 full rounds to win wins the game.. This is absolutely unfair.. I am highly disappointed.. Even though my internet connection is superb,my game goes on auto and I loose the game and it shows that there is no internet connection.I am uninstalling this rubbish and horrible game right now. Edit:The developers are not even taking note of this comment .Edit 2: I lost 43 games in a row because of this rubbish game."
545,Harmanjeet Singh,1,"This game is good , but If you are going to win they will show that your internet connection is not working . And if it is working they will give the opponent the exact number they want , either if they giving or they are hacking this game as this game can be easily hacked . I have Played many games and I can clearly see that , it is not biased for only first few games"
546,Renuka Thakur,1,If you want to play a *truly biased* game then only you should download it. Whenever you pass your opponent's token surely they will get that exact no which will cut off your token! Same happens when you are in your opponent's area. Also opponents will get 4 5 6 and you'll get 1 2 3 and you'll gett a 6 is once in a blue moon!!! Highly disappointed.
547,Vijay Kodakkat,1,"This app is not good. When playing the bot got more sixes but the players got less sixes , the players got ones or twos more . This is not good as we thinking. Don't download the game. But this is good only for playing with human , don't use bots in your play. Most time, the bots are ate me when we are at the finishing point. It breaks friendship and relationship, and makes fights. So dont download. The technology used in the game is not good..."
548,Abhigyan Anand,1,"Worst gaming experience ever. The game is biased. It simply targets one user as easy target and keeps on giving him 1 constantly to make him lose. Contrary to all the odds, if by chance that person is about to win sometimes, the other player can even get 6 6 5 if that cuts the former's token. Worst app programming ever. My strategy is what most people follow and I play according to absolute logic and common sense and still I haven't won a single game in ages. My suggestion: UNINSTALL RN"
549,Ankitraj Mishra,2,2 stars for look and feel. The algorithm sucks. 99% of the time we can predict when we or the opponent will get six or other no to hit the token... You will get the first six when your opponent is just behind your house. Or vice versa ...this looks likes fixed match This comment comes from me when I am at level 11 with daily login and daily gameplay. Don't tell me the dice numbers are random. Fix the algorithm first.. and why the hell there is no option of getting 3 times six in a row.?
550,Navdeep saini,1,You should start 5-6 player game also. Due to your policy of only 4 players in friends game.. our squad has faced a serious repurcussion. One of our friend minal has left our group in anger because we were not able to play game with her. This game has caused 2 nd mahabharat in our squad..please do something..and tell minal to join the squad group.
551,Archana Sharma,5,That's a wonderful game and also responds very quickly and nicely I spend my free time and when I get bored with ludo King 👑🤴 only
552,KarmVeer Singh,1,Algorithm on win or lose You can tell the algorithm on the start of a game this is garbage atleast provide fairplay.
553,Lokesh Meena,1,"Very poor..... My win streak was 92, Suddenly it became 2. And now it's started again from with 1. I logged out and login again and again, but all in vain. Also there is no importance of coins and diamonds. No matter how many coins you earn, but anyone can defeat you."
554,Santhosh Shetty,1,"After few games, you can predict the move. First fix algorithm. And f****ing every day some around 10.30pm to 11.30pm your game is under maintenance. This is ridiculous, we get time same around to play. Initially it was feeling nice to play the game, now feel like ............not to........ Important thing is that it's not a fair game....... Only higher level rankers will win and not others...."
555,prithvi akhil,3,"The game was great. During this quarantine me and my friends were enjoying this game. The game graphics , music,emotes,etc was great. But I didn't like some things . That we can make only 10 buddies for extra buddies why we want to give money? And in game description You told us that there will 2-6 are able to play this game. But I didn't see that mode?. Please Answer. Thank you \U0001f60a"
556,Karishma Bhadola,1,"I am not able to join a room with my friends and neither are they able to join my room. Even though our Game version is the same.. and The codes are still not working properly! Very poor gameplay in Play with friends mode; Also if this is the game we can play with our friends and family, why are we not able to join a existing room. Please fix this"
557,Jashandeep Singh,1,"My buddies are just gone , what's wrong with this game ? , Can't you fix this ? This is biggest problem with this game , and please add audio chat option too , like other games , maybe this can help to improve your game Another problem is adds , there are lots of adds after every match , please try to fix this issue Sometimes the request send my another buddy is not accepted by another one , it always show mismatch of version which is totally wrong , please try to fix this problem too"
558,Jyotishka Mandal,1,The number which is required at last never comes. I was just one place far from winning but one never came on dice but for my opponent completed one round and won at last. Atleast the probability of getting that number is 1/6 but my 15 throws didnt give 1. Not once or twice but 6times!!!!! I lost nearly 95000. Sometimes opponent keeps on getting six and gets the number to cut my player. Total waste
559,Anthony Sesay,3,Everytime I try to play the game it is always making me lose it tells me it is looking for an internet connection when the internet connection is working just fine the same thing happens to my wife. I have lost 10 Million because of what has happened and I bought that 10 Million. I WANT A REFUND IT HAS TAKEN THE VIRTUAL MONEY AWAY FROM ME THAT I HAVE BOUGHT!!! Please get back to me adress this issue and fix it! Thank You!
560,Khushi Saxena,1,"This game sucks... the computer selects a winner and a looser at the start ... everything is in favour of 1 player while there is a player who gets cut all the time ... probability is nowhere ... throughout the game we get a lot of ""1"" but at the end we get stuck at ""1"" which is required to win ... at that time we get a couple of sixes ... could have given 0 if possible .."
561,Isha Bhandari,1,I have been using the app from a long time but recently it's completely rigged. Numbers in the dice are not random at all. Seems that it's favouring one person . I have lost more than 20-25 games in a row . Have uninstalled the game and installed again . Now planning on uninstalling again. This should give a real time experience . Totally disappointed.
562,Nadeem Natrajan,1,"Clearly, the game tries to bring the match close and match the opponents. This is no fun. It takes the fun ourmt of the game. If you play with a person at a higher level, you win and if you play with the person at a lower level, you lose. It's made to look so obvious. There is no randomness to it."
563,swetha Vaddadi,1,"When none of my pawns are out, others pawns are almost entered the safe home. Seems completely biased and algorithms needs to be rewritten."
564,Jayant Parihar,1,Version are not same for Android and IPhone. So friends can not play Ludo with each other with different phone. Pls make same revision for IPhone and android. Otherwise remove revision restriction.
565,Ankush Singh,3,Overall game is good but there's huge issue of connectivity through the network. Most of the time the app opens but we are not able to play online or with our friends as it most of the time shows server issue although i try it with my wifi or mobile data. Also there are certain rules which needs to be updated for the game to be natural. But the connection issue is the major one. Please make necessary updates as soon as possible.
566,Tom Woods,2,"It's fun and competitive when playing with friends... however, whatever ""random"" dice generator they have programmed feels incredibly cheap and bias and in favour of your opponent, even if it is random, it certainly doesn't feel like it. It's hard to explain but it definitely feels unfair and looking at the other reviews I am glad it's not just me that is experiencing this"
567,Vamshi Krishna,1,One of the worst game in google play. It itself declares best game on google play but surely it's a stupid game I have ever seen\U0001f620. The dice is totally useless. When we want a number we dont get it but the opponent easily eat us. So I request to please improve it or don't post that it is the best game on google play.
568,Arshad km,1,"The game is biased. Dice algorithm is designed just to make the game more 'dramatic' and look interesting. If I cross anyone's house, it make sure that enemy gets 6 and release the token, and chase ours. If you have only one token remaining and you have all chances of winning, game will make sure opponent also reaches finishing point to increase your heartbeat. I am sure all have felt the same about the game, seeing others reviews."
569,Popat Bhosale,1,"It's been may be a week since I installed the app. Every single time at around 10 O'clock in the evening I go on try to play with friends online, it says Server is under maintenance. Now I'm not sure what kinda incorporates schedule their game servers for maintenance 7 days in a row at a user inconvenient time. Also the game is far more chance based than I had imagined. Skill has almost nothing to do with at a particular stage of gameplay. Like the beginning and the end. This sucks!!"
570,Liam Collins,1,"Absolutely fixed. Once I made a purchase for coins to complete missions, every single time I pass a player's home square, every single time they get the exact number they need to lift my token. Even if they don't have a token in the home square they'll get a 6 right away followed by the exact number they need to lift my token. I want my purchase refunded right away."
571,Ruqaiya Tanzeem,1,Very disappointed with this app when you're giving us feature that you can share room code to WhatsApp then why does it have to start again and again with only just minimizing it. I'd have given it zero star if there were option for that. Now it's stopping all of sudden. I'm in the middle of a game an after a few seconds the app stops. This is the worst app ever. Won't suggest any one to download this waste of data. And surprisingly the developer don't give damn. Going to uninstall it right now.
572,Vinay B n,1,"F***k this app developer. Worst app you will ever see. Don't deserve a single \U0001f31f. Even if I roll the dice 25-30 times I can't get 1. Nowadays even opponents get 1 easily to win when they roll the dice. Also I won't get the number I want to hit opponent player. But most of the time they will get the number to hit me. It happens in 2 players, 4 players. There is no algorithm. It is biased towards the players who have played less matches. Also when we play for 5k,10k matches 99% of the time we lose"
573,venkat bhel1987,1,The Game is really fantastic and interesting.but at the time of win we are facing some problems.The five lifeline chances are moving automatically and we are out of the game.we are losing many coins due to this problem.so rectify this problem. Otherwise we cannot play this game.If you did not rectify this problem means through Facebook and WhatsApp we will send messages to others to uninstall the app.so that your rating will be affected.
574,Jatin Rout,1,"Worst experience. I am trying to play with my friend every evening and always getting error"" system under maintainence"". Now a days ludo king is not giving any service to its customers. It is only concentrating on earning money and on ads. Guys unstall this and use some other app which is better than this. If ludo king see this comment they will only say sorry for the inconvenience. That only they can say. Worst experience."
575,Sachin sehrawat,1,"Such a sucking game it is ! My level got promoted recently and after that only mine ludo pieces are not opening dont know whats wrong with my dice, while other's ludo pieces goes inside the winning corner while my 4 pieces remains inside,if by chance any of my ludo piece get open , it again goes inside after a few momments which really really sucks ! Developers should do something in this regard as this is getting worse day by day."
576,Mitali Shrivastava,5,I love this app.. it binds my whole family together in the of difficulties. So I give you Thumbs up for all the efforts to the entire team.
577,Priyanka Malakar,1,Too bad this game because in most of my cases all the coupons go into the main court before everyone but walk away without winning and after a while the others participants win...😡😠😡😠😡😠
578,Sana Khan,5,Game is awesome but need more update like voice calling on play with freind option after that it will be double awesome.
579,Anushka Sharma,1,"This is a terrible game\U0001f621...earlier it used to be much better , much fun, the dices was rolled accordingly ( random)doing no discrimination but now it's so unfair...i played 4,5 times in a row nd lost all the games,in what world is that possible?? Are they paying you more or something like tht? This game seems to favour those who have higher coins. And how can a person earn more if you don't let them win even once..Extremely disappointed \U0001f623\U0001f614This is disgusting..."
580,Ancy Diana,1,"Very worst game ever seen. In starting time i played continuously so everytime I won the match after that now a days am playing frequently I lost the match. I was waiting for the Dhayam and the opponent person put 6 and round the full board and won I was waiting for Dhayam. Now a days I don't have chance to cut the opponent coin,they only cut my coins more than 10times. Very very worst game."
581,Chayna Ray,1,Connection problem is too annoying. Always looses connection while playing the game.
582,Garima Singh,1,"Worst online game ever played in my life. I m rating this game 1 star because i can't have 0 to rate, if there was a 0 then i had definately rated it as 0. It supports only one player who had win the previous matches and that also because of this fake game. Don't waste time on it u should try another online game instead of this J2 game."
583,Arshad Ali,1,Most irritating and worst app. Game will struck in between for 2-3 minutes which leads you to loss the game.
584,Reshma Shaik,2,I don't know how this game works. It's like always my opponent wins!always!its really sucks!hating this game nowadays
585,RINKU LAKHANPAL,1,I install this game on 5 -1-2020 and running good but it feel biased i lost 6 match back to back . Some time very hard to get 6 and other players get 6-6-6 multiple times. So i uninstall it. After a month again i install but same thing happened no change done on game fully biased and froud so i uninstall it . Few weeks later again install it but same result i won 2 matchs after that i lost 7 match back to back and lost all coin . Losing match back to back not motivate in positive way so uninstal
586,CHOKSTAR,1,"Biased Algorithm I played more than 15 matches. Everytime, by some magic, the first person to get the 6 for the first time wins the game. I have won 3 times and I have seen, the end result is always the same. Such flawed and Biased algorithm. So first, someone gets the 6 ramdomly, from there, the algorithm just magically let that person win. I won magically. All my opponents had all their pieces reached their final 5 block before the Home. 2 of my pieces were outside. I magically won that game"
587,Mohammad Tahir,1,Never seen this kind of distractions on connecting server. For the whole day it was showing the same. You can only play with the computer that too you itself will win always. It doesn't interested. When you connect to play with your friends I don't know it is possible in this planet. I never played a single game with my frnds using the code via online. For offline it is okay.
588,Mehwish Zuhair,3,I personally think that it's a good game over all....if we talk bout' the algorithm and the maintenance it's literally the best! But sometimes if feel like I ain't getting suitable number for my game and the opponent is getting the best number..I really don't know what's happening! Best game! But fix this problem. Thankyou.
589,alice goes,1,"Very biased game. Disgusting! Clearly the computer pre decides the winner, if the opponent is of a higher level, no matter how far they are dey win. I need 1 to win and my opponent had 3 coins outside. But my opponent won and i dont understand how. It happens with all the games. Me, my family and friends are gonna uninstall the game."
590,P.S.P Gaming,1,"Worst game ever! Whenever I play online , this game shows internet connection problem but my internet connection is fine with high speed. But this game shows connectivity problem. So I wait but nothing happens and after sometime it automatically left the match. Due , to this I lose continuously by the last 2-3 days. My money decreases from 70,000 to 2,000 due to this. Pease don't download this poor game. There are many other ludo games that you can download."
591,Mayur Kamde,1,"I enjoyed playing this game before but now it's like the enemy get the exact numbers which they want, every body is at the end of the game and I'm still inside and when it gets out one of the enemy kills me and it's been constantly happening for days and I've played almost 20+ games in which I've been killed whenever I'm out or either i'm still waiting for 6!!! This game is completely biased.. not fair..!"
592,Parth Doshi,1,"It's fun playing with friends on this app! But the problem is that it keeps crashing on every One Plus device. I have tried playing it in one plus 7, 7t and 8. It crashes inside 2 min. If by then I have started the game I also loose out on the coins. I request the developers to please look into this and update the app with support for one plus devices. Surely a 5 star review post that! Thanks."
593,Tej Deep Singh Sodhi,3,Its the great app but I want to deduct 2 stars because I want if all the four players can talk side by side while playing this game like PUBG which will give the reality effect to this game . The words and expressions of the people after their goti gets cut will be interesting thing . Please give us this audio call feature in next update \U0001f44d\U0001f618.
594,Sandeep Sahni,1,"I must say this is totally biased game as I m playing from 2 month and I mean it. At a particular point of time and step dices are open and for the persons who pay some to bay something, that opening of dices procedure becomes automatically fast...Every step is fixed, every movement of dices are questionable. This game is just developed to earn money nothing more than that.. It's not following at all the game spirit. Google must remove such type of biased games. Only 1 star for this."
595,sharanya raj,1,"This game is a piece of junk. The app crashes 100 times. No matter without playing the game, you are supposed to loose it due to the bug this app has and forever this people will not be able to get it sorted. I did drop a mail, followed all the trouble shooting steps. Inspite of which the app got crashed. I am rating it in a star. Since I do not have an option to rate it Nil. Otherwise this app deserves a big 0. Buddy issue fixed - Maintenance Issue fixed Nothing is fixed. Do not lie"
596,Shebin Shaju,1,"I like this game. The opponents gets the bigger numbers and the exact numbers they wanted, when iam supposed to win i never win. And every time iam the last one to come out; when others are almost to finish. I got angry because of it and almost i cracked my phone. Some stupid people made this game. And they give priority to the paid ones i think. Game is for our opponets, we never wins"
597,Neeraj Singh,1,"Few points for this game: 1) Game is not fair, algorithm built is based on predictable features. 2) Dice number are not random, they are decided by algorithm, and algorithm is too poor. 3) Most of the time servers are under maintenance. 4) You get bored after a week of playing, you can figure out the next move/next dice number, which means games becomes predictable and less interesting. Advice: Hire some good programmer. hence leaving the game after a week."
598,Jadish Mitter,1,This is so biased. I am very disappointed with the fact that it only makes the opponent win and even if my tokens are all in only one is out then also the opponent will win. This happened to me more than once every time I play online I kept on losing. Very very disappointing
599,Ananya Likhdhari,2,"The experience was good before. Now it seems as if the dice does not rolls out a random value, the game is biased. It seems as if the winner is decided before the game starts on the basis of paid and unpaid players and dice gets rolled according to the defined algorithm. This has happened continuously for more than 10 times. Its irritating to see this happen manifold."
600,Arun Pahadi,1,Sucks.. While I open the app to play I don't know how my friends profile getting login in to my device and he has been logging out in the middle of the running game from his device? Although we never logged in to our devices from each others ID's. Cons. * Drainage of battery is so fast. * Heating issue. * Privacy concern issue. * Auto logout in the middle of the game. * Dice roll algorithm sucks. * so many inappropriate ads. * Bugs needs to be fixed when it comes to online gaming.
601,Pankaj Kumar,1,"Fraud game. Every time at the end it will need no 1. Opponent players have 3 and 4 remaining and still they will won the game but you will not get no 1. It's a fraud and waste of time. Not deserve single star. That's why they do advertising too much and have 80 percent fake reviews by paid reviwer. Don't waste time to install this app. I am going to uninstall right now. How can be possible, need dice no 1 and other opponents have more the 3 remaining , still you will lose the game."
602,Harsh Parmar,1,"I am uninstalling this game. This game is broken always have issues. I have faces glitch many times. And it seems they have fixed the pattern of the dice. When your token or other player token is there, your dice will always get that number so you can kill his token. Game should be unpredictable and without any 3rd party control over it. Why at the end all players needs only 1 to win? And Who has only one token to get in, he never wins. Make it free same as we used to play when we're Young. \U0001f611"
603,Aniket Khadapkar,5,"It's good timepass, but I have faced a weird problem. I was playing online and guy on the other side was playing veru very slow intentionally for me to run out of patience. Used to play dice at the very end of time. While reporting such douchbag I needed an other option where I can describe the problem."
604,Sunil Bestha,1,"Something has changed all of a sudden. Game looks biased since last few days. Just One 4 player game went for almost 1 hr 30 min, because the opponents get exact numbers including 6 to kill the other players. We are shocked to see the same thing happening 10s of times in just one game. Also when I play online I used to win but now in just 2 days I lost kinda 10 games straight, loosing almost 4 lakh coins. How can that happen all of a sudden, some bots involved ? Uninstalled the game............"
605,nishant patni,1,"I suppose after updation, there is lots of bug in software. I got 28 times 1 and never get 6 first time when opponent kill my token. When I kill his token he gets 6 very first time. I observe this fraud when I killed his token 4 to 5 times and every time he was getting 6 in very first chance. Before updation it worked fine. I suppose.... You resolved the previous bug but introduced new more bugs or else regretion testing has not been done upto satisfactory level."
606,Saurabh Singh,1,"I think the algorithm or programming is very horrible. It will never let you win online, if you are sure shot winning then it will give network error and you will be out of game or the opponent get exact number that will kill your token, even if it is 6 and 5 together. Very poor game. Uninstalling"
607,syed sufwan,1,"It's a biased game. When you don't have enough coins to join any game then we have to watch ads or buy coins. To make sure we need to watch ads or buy coins, it doesn't allow us to win any games as the opponent gets the number which they need and we will not get the required number. This happened for around 10 games to me. So, it definitely looks like a strategy to make users watch ads or buy coins."
608,Sakthivel Udayakumar,3,This is a good. Nowdays people are playing this game more and there arises the problem sometimes the joining in room by using code are not working properly. Suddenly a unkown ID joins in the room and even takes two positions(tokens) in the game. This makes us think that is this game is hacked or something else. Players in online has more win streaks that i have never seen before since i used to play this for years. Make it right it will be fun again!!
609,Hemlata Ranwa,1,"Please add zero star option...i need to give it zero star..biased game..time waste game...irritating game...When I drove the dice 30 times, then ""1"" comes only 2 times...While ""1"" should have come five times. .....biased due to....\U0001f447 (1). Number 6 comes only 2 times continuously always (2). Some times If a player is ahead by 6,6,4 Then another player will also get 6,6,4 and the token will be hit. (3). When all tokens are one behind each consecutive Then nothing except 6 and 5 comes on the dice."
610,Yogesh Umaranikar,1,Every now and then the game is crashing when playing with online players ... Even updating from play store...
611,krits3112,3,"I'm giving you 3 star because this game is helping in ensuring some time pass with friends and good moments, but seriously, you don't deserve it. Firstly, I really doubt that the dice roll is completely random, if the opponent is left with one piece then my pieces final reach the home lane and then the opponent wins, I mean why do you keep the other party engaged! Secondly, I think that your code has some grudges against me, seriously man, this is not done, everyone beats my pieces."
612,Gurleen Kaur,1,"Game is bias because whenever you are playing the game online , also you are playing good and just one step to win while another player who is not even closer to thier house gets the number on the dice which they want and win , atlast you lost with just one step. It happens with me everytime I play online."
613,sanket chaugule,2,"The game is fun to play but  When you want 6 it never comes when you want 1 it never comes and from the opponent side it comes like anything whenever he/she needs. you cannot win, it makes you lose every time you are on the streak of 2 or even 1. And if you get a chance to kill your opponent's pawn it's very hard to get that number. Please provide us a FAIR gameplay or if you are unable to do this then remove this game. \U0001f620#JaiLuudoJi\U0001f64f"
614,Rajkamal Chaubey,1,"Wrost game ever , some players never get the desired number while the same time other opponent get all the desired number in game. There is a bug in game , if you play multiplayer game suddenly your connectivity is interrupted and next you are not able to play. And game is end and you are lost the game . This is happening again and again while my mobile network is working fine. This issue need to be fix as soon as possible."
615,Asah Ideana,1,"Sometimes I lost my internet connection, and then I have to close and restart the game. This is happen not only in once time, but more and more until my stars power empty. When play with four player, just only one player can play with normal playing without lost the power. When this player have rolling dice, his token can move many times at the same time, no matter he have 6 number or not. I thing someone use cheater for this game."
616,Paper Shredders,1,"Dear Developer, I have a question for you. Why can't you put random number algorithm in this game. Whenever I come close to my opponent, I eat from him. This shows that if you get close to the opponent, you are sure to eat. Sorry, but it's not interesting, instead it depresses me to my core and demolishes me. The dice are completely biased. If I could give you a 0 rating, I would. In truth, I'm fed up with my sh *** y game. Please improve the game."
617,Sukanya halder,2,"It is a fraud game. The player with high number of coins or higher in level always wins. The loser always gets lower number on dice throws while the winner gets 6-6-5 most of the times. Dice is biased. Rather it is based on algorithm. There is no strategy you can use of your own. If you do all your tokens will be crossed, the game makes sure it totally makes you a loser. This is my review just before uninstalling the game."
618,Ronak Harpawat,2,What the hell is wrong with your game. It's crashing again and again. I lost 7L out of 8L. I have a superb internet connection. But it shows no connection. That no connection appears only after starting game. At the very 1st place if there is no connection it shouldn't connect me to other online players. But it does. And after game starts it shows no connection. I am facing this issue from last three days. Please help me and look into the matter. Else I have to stop playing your game.
619,Avneet Kaur,1,"I have played this game many times. And i have understood that the makers have made the algorithm to attract more players. Newer the player, more the dice favours the player. The developers have killed the essence of the game..which is lucky roll. No longer there is any luck involved in this game. Algorithm makes sure that one player is favoured in the game. No longer feels like Ludo."
620,Nitin Pattanayak,1,"This is probably third or fourth time I'm uninstalling this rubbish game app, thought of downloading all the times that may be these scumbags might have changed the control and given to the players. But, again I'm wrong all the algorithms have already prefixed and I'm challanging the developer to play with me and I'll predict that what number will come next and who's gonna win. Just waste of time, don't know how come people are playing such game."
621,Sivajini Kathiresu,1,"Full Bias & scripted. When ur 2 pawns are in consective boxes. You will never get one. Even if u want to have one to cut opponent. In the same way, if ur pawns are with one Gap, you will never get2. The Game were never allow you to keep 2 pawns in one place ezcept in special boxes. So game numbers are 100% depended not random. Game is controlled by them. Funny! Can App developers say No? But, I'm ready to prove.It's a open challenge to the developers. Why not responding over 10days. I'm waiting"
622,Rising of Hope,1,"If there is any negative marking, i wish to give that to ludo king. Worst game set. No natural numbers.The game always seems like pre-set. Continuously same thing repeating. One person getting 6s like a bundle and other person stucked quarantine at home. Game is good but kindly make it natural, not a already set game. There are to many things repeating always. Kindly solve it. I frustated with this game due to this kind of blunder inside the game. Minus Rating Game. No Good. Unhappy"
623,Ruzveh Dadabhoy,1,"It is surprising that many people despite of giving one star to this game it still shows 4 star on google play store. ...... To talk about the game if there were negative star i would be glad to give the same to this game. ...... WARNING: Dont waste your time playing this game. I played lots of games with online players. The game is good looking, works good online but there is one major flaw in the game...... The rolling of dice is not in your hands. Which means that winning the game is not in your hands.If so then why the game waits for us to dice the roll. Straight away the computer should roll it and tell me what it is. Since the control of the dice is in the hands of the app it decides what you will get (12,3,4,5,6).. As a result there will be a point where the app will make you lose purposely. I have seen the case of cheating many times. No matter how smarly you play than the opponent you will end up losing. And this will happen frequently. It comes to a point of frustration level. When you play with a strategy and experience you get paid like this. It is really disappointing.. Now i am at a stage where out of 10 games i am winning only 1. And it becomes very evident that the app is making you lose purposely even though the opponent is novice user or even expert than you..... I really wished if this game had dice control in out hands rather then the app decides what i will get. Once they correct this then this game will become more fun and interesting."
624,xyan hell,1,"Who on Earth set the algorithms for this game, world most irritating and frustrating game. Come on, everytime i need 1 to win and all my 3 opponents are at their bases but just to get the 1 i have to wait until all the 3 come out from their respective bases and then what i see out of nowhere a random guy wins. And normally my token never comes out of my base untill someone come from behind and then cut my token and then when i have to run away i get 4-5 series of 1. Such a disgraceful app."
625,Dhinesh r,1,"Have you ever felt like why I am loosing most of the time? First question for you is "" Do you watch ads to get coins?"".. if so you will loose most of the time..... The game profiles you to choose you as looser so that you will end up watching more and more ads. The face values you get are not random... They are programmed to defeat you... It's in other sense , cheating game... I am never going to play this game anymore...."
626,Sumit Tripathi,1,Disgusting game. I know there is always a win and defeat in a game and you also can't be always the winner. I agree with this point but when you know you are going to be the winner and you tried 1000 times to come over a bad situation but the opposition will get all the numbers to kill you even in a weird way where you haven't ever imagined someone will come and you are waiting for a good dice to come but believe me you won't get. Initially you won't get such things. Just be at level 10. 1 perso
627,Kavita Chatar,1,"It's a really bad game design. It's alway obvious that if opponent is closer we will definitely kill it. Even if it requires 2 six and exactly 1 four. Opponent will surely throw the same number and kill my piece.. this is never possible in real game. Have played this game so many times and it had happened several times. It's very biased sometimes. Opponent will get continuously 3 Six, and I got consecutively 7 ones. So unfair.. never possible in real game.. change your algorithm.."
628,SUSHIL SATAPATHY,5,"Great game for leisure but I can not believe myself admitting that it is the best way to get a chance to keep a contact with your friends and family in a real time room experience! Great job by the app developer \U0001f44f\U0001f44f\U0001f44f\U0001f44f\U0001f64f BUT STILL THERE'S A SUGGESTION from my side is to provide a voice chat option in ""play with friends""section so that the game would be more enjoyable. Thank you"
629,arijit das,1,"Its a very biased game. Winning stats are just horrible. I have played this game for 15 times, and that 10 times with my female cousin and one time with my sister and that too today, my winning stat is 1:14 , in total 8 games, and i have loose 14 straight times to them. If your loops and algorithms are set then why do always your priority is given to female players. My female comapanions don't have any stats bt have won just due to bigger case of no . I wouldn't recomend this to any on."
630,Aman Patel,2,"Wierd thing happened to me after I paid to remove the ads. If there is a luck setting assigned to each player, that variable kind of updated to 0 for me and I then lost around 25 games consecutively and dramatically. Before paying I won around twice as much as I lost. After paying I wanted to uninstall the game. Is this some strategy for those who paid already to leave the game since there is no more benifit coming from them. They're just loading up the server. If yes please remove it."
631,Dimple Vaswani,1,Its the worst game i've played...when i'm about to win i suddenly loose all my tokens and yet others win so easilyy.. so unfair
632,taruna c,2,"The game is unfair...makes the game always come to end where everyone is at same level no matter how they went throughout the game. Also, at times when a person just needs one to finish or win his/her game one never comes and the player who still has one round remaining, completes its and wins the game while the other person is still stuck in there and struggle to get one . Otherwise it's all luck!"
633,Pratibha Yadav,1,I am also agree with this....that after updation something went wrong continue I lost the game 19 time whatever the next person want he or she get....and they always win even if I gonna to win but I don't get that thing and if opponent having three dice left ...even than they got victory and I have only one dice i didn't get wht i want.. something really went wrong after updation of the app really worst thing is this....\U0001f621\U0001f621\U0001f621\U0001f621\U0001f621\U0001f621
634,Unnati Singh,1,Sorry unfortunately I gave only single star because of some serious problems in ludo king . I realized that small amount of online matches are able to win easily and properly . But large amount of matches are lost every time . Why is this soo ??? I tried many times and also I lost money . But this problem is not solved Plz solve this problem
635,purnima kanojia,1,Mf game. It has so many bugs. When opt for 4p you only get 3p and the 4th player is invisible. I thought this might be a connection problem but no. It's the game. Even when you win it'll show that you have lost the game and automatically the number of coins get deducted.
636,SAGAR KAMRANI,1,"Worst game ever..totally biased..this game enhances partiality..it favours the one player by more 6s,exact number to cross other opponents and properly the digits to teach the final..from last 20 games either i don't get sixes or everytime I'm crossed..And if by God's grace my all four pieces reach the final I get large number of sixes and never the exact number to clear..Game has started sucking my mind!!Never gonna install it again I swear...worst algorithm witnessed..Negative Rating for you!!"
637,Chetan Akkannavar,1,Frustrating. Automatically goes offline and never comes back.losing games because of connection issue.
638,Shireen Sayed,3,"Terribly biased outcomes,rolls. Absolutely frustrating experience. Please do work on it.you need to review the software inputs asap!!"
639,harish patha,1,It's a very good application with worst logic. I bet there is nothing random but is well written. I'll list out few cases here: 1. How come the dice show up 6 immediately after opponent gets it? It happens almost every time for me. 2. How come dice does not show up 1 which u are waiting for but rolls 6s and 6s one after other for opponent?very random ryt? 3. When ur 3 bots are in home and waiting for 4th pending with just 1 position will never win. Opponent with 3 bots outside will easily do.
640,kiran kumar,1,"Biased Algorithm I don't know what's the reason behind this. Some times I'm favoured getting 6,5,5 consistently making me to win. Sometimes I get only one or two making me lose the game despite the situation is favourable to me. I feel that the dice is not random and is biased towards one player. Even though I enjoy playing game through this app, What's the point of playing when the game is not fare. Hope the developers understand this. I'm giving the review after playing a high number of games"
641,Sneha Naik,1,"Thought to be a good one... But drastically it changed out to be annoying since my tokens was not moving the way I tried to move then, it was as if someone else is controlling my tokens... Worst one to deal with... Wondering whether there is any cheatcode to do so by the opponent? Coz I am not aware about it... Please deal with this annoying issue!!! All the best"
642,Tushar Garg,1,"This app has an algorithm that disregards probability to make the game more interesting and longer so that average time per user is increased. In it, if there is a pawn which can be cut, it's probability should be 1/6 but in the app, it is more so that the game becomes long. Manipulates people who do not have idea about game algorithms or probability"
643,Piya Mane,1,"Certainly not happy with this game as it chooses certain players and are given priority over others and they are always destined to win no matter how many times they are taken down or how far they are from their house. When I'm just one step away from getting into the house , other players overtake and win all the time!!! Algorithm seems to be pretty messed up!!!! Not happy at all!\U0001f612"
644,Sankalp,1,"Biased app. When I play with computer, I win by getting lots of sixes, fives etc. But, when I play online, I always get 1 or 2. And the other player gets lots of six etc. and always kills my tokens by getting the required number. And I always get 1 and get to return home, when the opponent 'kills' my tokens. Very frustrating and disappointing. UnInstalling right away even after having more than 150,000 coins... Life is now lot more happier after deleting this app...\U0001f917"
645,Abhijit shetty,2,I don't think it's all programmed using random number logic. We believe it's a sheer luck when it's not. I have noticed a behavioural occurance of number based on the rank people have and very often noticed this when one nearly reaches to another hut. Bug: Not yet stable at online multiplayer platform. Thrown internet error at the very crucial stage. Tried with different network but the fault was a bug it seems. Arrrrh.
646,Nixon Johny,1,"The game is good. But I dont know why the game is misbehaving. If i has been kicked out of the game (Due to network issue), i'm rejoining to a different game with only two players and can't play the game. And eventually i will be kicked out from the original match, timed out. It happened to me 3 times in a row. I hope developers will fix this problem. Also phone's battery is drained quickly followed by heating up ,when playing. I think it need more optimization for miui 11 (whyred)."
647,preetham Kanvapuri,5,"this game is awesome. it is not written that every game we play, we must win. but this game is based on selection. you have selected whether you have to start a new one or continue. by the way, thank s game needs concentration rather to simply say that it gives our opponent the correct number required to hit us. that doesn't waste our time and moreover it unites families"
648,Swarup Suryawanshi,1,"there is actually a pre-defined pattern, and the outcome is set to be fair for everyone, if someone is getting 1 continuously, it will stsrt giving 6 automatically and the outcome is quite predictable, which is why whoever has understood algorithm and touch the dice at the exact time only that person is going to win, it doesn't matter how hard you try playing fairly, other person always wins"
649,YashPreet Kaur,1,"1. This game looks programmed. If we play against higher level or people who have bought stuff in the game, most of the dices go into their favour 2. This game lags severely I was playing matches and I almost won but somehow it started lagging and my opponent who was no where close to winning somehow won 3. If it isn't lagging it will start showing internet connection issues while there are none and same thing happens again that the opponent who is no where close to winning wins."
650,Sathvik,4,Tthe game is good but my friends are getting all 6 and I am getting only 1. One time I lost by not getting a single token out. In real life board game my luck is awesome and their luck sucks. But in online it's the opposite. I want u to make the game realistic. It's not realistic coz they are winning make me win. This is my in game name:H\xc8LLD\xc9STR\xd8Y I reinstalled ludo coz I lost every single match and I am out of coins. This is my fifth time reinstalling... If I don't win next time I will quit
651,Vikas Kumar,1,"It's move tokens automatically, apponent token changed move after the selection. If opponent select a token and move there after instantly they change the first token move and reset the first selection, afterthat they move 2nd token. I don't know how is it possible. Very worst thing I see Today while playing. May be bugs available in this game."
652,Amal Suresh,1,"Poor Game. Same set of algorithm for the dice. A person playing for a week knows how to manage the game with the algorithms. Plus the dice doesn't roll despite having played by the user and end up losing attempts, and eventually the match without even playing one legitimate move even when having strong mobile network. Terrible."
653,RAJAT SHARMA,1,"The worst game and so many players are hacker in it, I think the people are blind who is playing or the company does not care about their goodwill, they just want people to waste there time. I have some doubts also that they are promoting hackers by not making there security tight. The worst thing which I hate is thag the game deny the network while it is at day's peak."
654,Lalith Choudhury,1,Every time i play i loose think i have played totally 134 matches till now i won only 70 and lost 64 ... So stupid game. Every time the opponent wins the Match... If i want one to win and opponent has three coins near his starting line then he wins... Now can't i get 1 atleast once but no I didn't get... This is waste uninstalled waste of time ... Better than this is tik tok ... Everyone uninstall it fast.. \U0001f621\U0001f621\U0001f621\U0001f635\U0001f635
655,Akshat Agrawal,1,"It's actually poorly coded. Even if you have 3 tokens inside your house, there are 95% chances that you end up losing the game as 5he person outside can come all the way and win. Don't know how does the probability system works in this game. I have been losing most of games even though I have 3 tokens already inside the house. Download some other app folks!"
656,Collette LOMAX,1,"I would give this 0 star if I could. Everytime u go for level 4 in the crown(win 5 games at 100000,) it teams u up with computer people (Indians or asians) when u contact support. They ask for a screen shot. I have sent over 10, they do not respond. I have got lots of friends in uk playing this with me. They all have problems on the 100 thousand games. Avoid at all costs. This is a cash cow. Maybe I need to change where I reside."
657,Tanveer Dhiman,1,Worst app ever each time they say they fixed buddy issue but each time during that update they forgot to put add as buddy button within profile screen...
658,piyush shekhar,2,Very predictive patterns. A player or you enter anyone's base or your own base. You will get a six. It will show that you are winning and make you lose in the end and vice versa. You will win a series of games in the first few weeks.....and then you will keep losing ...that is the pattern
659,Darshit Shah,1,Worst experience I'm trying to saw video and it's not playable... and it is not natural ludo game you fix everything
660,Anisha Singh,1,"There is no randomness at all and the winner is already decided in the beginning of the game....worst game...nobody should waste time on such a game. No matter how hard you try the algorithm is set in such a way that you will lose no matter what .One person will get all the nice rolls while the other person doesnt,this game is flawed to another level."
661,Rajarshi Gupta,1,Looks like this game is biased towards players who play and win regularly.. Not for people who play once in a while.. Cos I lose all of the time only cos my dice hardly throws six.. Same goes for two of my friends.. However few I know play on a regular basis and they throw the biggest numbers possible and whenever required.. This is an honest feedback..
662,Nishtha Tenguria,1,"I am not able to join a room with my friends and neither are they able to join my room. Even though our Game version is the same..... and The codes are still not working properly! Very poor gameplay in Play with friends mode; Also if this is the game we can play with our friends and family, why are we not able to join a existing room. Please fix this or you can be called out for fake advertising"
663,Priya Dwivedi,1,Worst algorithm used. How can one lose always? Another person in the game gets 6 or 5 always....while another gets 1 or 2 only. One player keeps waiting for 1 to win.... another us still at home. Another one wins the game and former one keeps waiting for 1. This is my experience after playing apprpx 100 games. You guys really need to improve your randomisation function. Please study probability thoery and come up with some good algorithm. Totally partial. \U0001f44e
664,Nagaraj Bg,2,"1. Buddies added disappear automatically after some time.... 2.Eventhough im playing fast Automoves are Exhausting on their own.... 3.Eventhough there is a stable network it shows unstable network and because of this Im loosing coins in the middle of the game.... 4.If the buddy request sent my buddies not accepted suddenly,it will not appear in the buddy request column creating confusion for both players,so please solve these problems...."
665,Shawn Soares,2,"Honestly, I'm always a big fan of ludo, but you guys made me hate it, why? Cause your algorithm seems to be 1. Sexist 2.Baised, I have gotten a whole game with just one 6 to get someone out and rest all 1s! Fix your game and your algorithm !!! I have even made notes on the number of time I got a number and I've gotten more 1s and 2s than my whole family playing the game"
666,Isaack Yt,5,"Very nice game, i am killing Nash nonstop.. And she is always losing. Five stars for that."
667,Sohum Padhi,3,"Hi! I loved your game, good work guys... But, i am facing a problem... I play this game a lot and i lose sometimes and lose coins. So to keep Playing, i watch aads and take the surveys and quizzes. But, after completing the surveys, I don't receive any money.. Can you guys add a ""reduce time"" in the diamonds also? Like you have in the coins? I hope you do it"
668,Shubhank Singh,1,I must say that this game doesn't depends on your luck. But it runs runs according to a strategy. If you won 1 or 2 matches back to back then in 3rd match you have to loose. Because this game doesn't let you win. If your 3 tokens are in and you only need 1 or 2 to win the match then you will never get it. And finally your opponent wins the match which is very annoying and disgusting. (Worst experience compare to other ludo games)
669,Keya mandana shaw,4,"Sometimes takes too long to find players to play with. Can drain you iPhone battery pretty bad if the game goes on for too long. Takes a while to get a six and forever to get a one. Best wait it out for a while. You get 4 chances before time runs out. If someone leaves a game, you win. Themes are quite interesting and spin the wheel to earn coins! Definitely a classic, fun game to play with friends or by yourself during this lockdown. Better server connection & play with wifi or strong 4G."
670,MAHESH BABU KANDI,3,"Dear developer I like the game but I have some queries: 1. Does the Dice have algorithm according to game? or random? Please explain. 2. Is 7 UP DOWN dices algorithm scripted? 3. In algorithm programming, random algorithm has also some logic and sequence, (i) does it depend on situation of the game? Or (ii) purely random algorithm is not at all possible, isn't it? Please answer my questions and explain accordingly to increase the trust of players."
671,Lahif Dasurkar,1,Algorith of dice is too predictable. I you enter an are where the opponent has no tokens out you will definitely die as he gets 6 and number which he wants to kill the opponent token.Also in the end it is made sure that it is a close finish. You will hardly get the 1 or 2 required to finish the game in few tries and opponent reaches to the same situation. If you want to run away from the opponent in closing stages when one token is left and opponent has 3 he will catch you even you are far ahead
672,Gaurav Pandey,1,"The most rigged game you will ever see. The players who have played this a lot and more experience, are given the best dice rolls and it can be clearly seen that it's rigged. The dice rolls are not random. It's most idiotic game you can play. But yes it's a time pass and its ridiculously bad in graphics"
673,Gawthii,2,This game is biased.. it gives the good moves to the other player always...i have played 50 games with my partner and have seen this game giving him exact moves he would need to cut me multiple times... It's like this game hates me and wants me to lose...i must have won very few times no matter what strategy i apply..
674,Manindra Prabhakar,4,"Plz make sure that 5 or 6 friends can play together in online mode,as it is already available in offline mode@gametion technology pvt ltd"
675,Subbu Rathnam Durbha,1,"If there's any possibility I'll rate it zero. Worst ludo game I've ever played. Always frustrating adds while I play and dice. gosh!! I'm running out of time due to those adds. Couldn't they play adds after all the game over ? All the time, the dice also shows bias.... I know it's based on luck.. But definitely not that unlucky.. Hope you understand my frustration !"
676,Deepika B,1,"I like the fact that we can play online with friends in another country. Latest update has worsened the game - cannot join room, automatically tokens are going, unable to join room. I had to edit my review from 5 stars to 2. I just downloaded another ludo game. And now after fixing the problem, maybe bcz I gave 2 stars, I never win. I get one 6 and the entire game is played just with one token. Lost 1 lac coins in this. Is this intentional to make me not play here?"
677,P Jyothsna,1,Unfair game. Purposely it stops my coins and allow the opponent to move ahead of me and I loose. Happened 100 of times. Fed up loosing. I feel like I am the most unluckiest in the world. I don't know what kind of maintenance you do daily at night. No change in algorithms. Very very very upset with this illogical dice. If you are not going to fix this problem I and all my friends and family members will uninstall it.
678,Urvashi Joshi,1,"Updated your last version of 5.0.0.153. Seems there is some issue in connectivity. Before that it ran well. I played online multi-player games. But now after update as i start the game my profile keeps on loading. No coins or diamonds Show up. All zero 0. Daily spin keeps on loading. Watch video option keeps on loading. Selecting multi-player game option shoes ""connecting to server"" and then it keeps on loading. It has become useless to me now. Data connectivity and other apps working fine."
679,Alister Joseph,1,"Worst game of all time, the algorithm is not properly set. There is no way fair chances oor opportunities are given to each player. Worst experience of my life. I had to give atlest one star or else they will not accept it.. But seriously man, Such a waste of time."
680,DHAIRYA BHARDWAJ,2,"It was good game in starting but after 2 days only i saw the true nature of this game. It's like the games are fixed, i am playing with one of my friends for the past week and i have lost every single game, even in online mode it's like whenever i am in my opponents cube, he gets the exact number which he wants and when he is mine he always manages to get a 6 and escape. And he always get so many 6 and i am stuck 1 or 2. Is the dice really random? But 2 stars just for unfair plays."
